Opinion




 [*224]  [***599]  [****233]  [**707]     Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to BCRA Titles III and IV. * 
This opinion addresses issues involving miscellaneous Title III and IV provisions of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), 116 Stat 81.  For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the District Court with respect to these provisions. 
 BCRA § 305
[33A] BCRA § 305 amends the federal Communications  [****234]  Act of 1934 (Communications Act) § 315(b), 48 Stat 1088, as amended, 86 Stat 4, which requires that, 45 days before a primary or 60 days before a general election, broadcast stations must sell a qualified candidate the "lowest unit charge [*225]  of the station for the same class and amount of time for the same period," 47 USC § 315(b) [47 USCS § 315(b)].  Section 305's amendment, in turn, denies a candidate the benefit of that lowest unit charge unless the candidate "provides written certification to the broadcast station that the candidate (and any authorized committee of the candidate) shall not make any direct reference to another candidate for the same office," or the candidate, in the manner prescribed in BCRA § 305(a)(3), clearly identifies herself at the end of the broadcast and states that she approves of the broadcast. 47 USC §§ 315(b)(2)(A), (C) (Supp. II)[47 USCS §§ 315(b)(2)(A), (C)] . 
The McConnell plaintiffs challenge § 305.  They argue that Senator McConnell's testimony that he plans to run advertisements critical of his opponents in the future and that he had run them in the past is sufficient to establish standing.  We think not. 
[34]Article III of the Constitution  [****235]  limits the "judicial power" to the resolution of "cases" and "controversies." One element of the "bedrock" case-or-controversy requirement is that plaintiffs must establish that they have standing to sue.  Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 818, 138 L. Ed. 2d 849, 117 S. Ct. 2312 (1997).  On many occasions, we have reiterated the three requirements that constitute the "'irreducible constitutional minimum'" of standing.  Vermont Agency  [***600]  of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 771, 146 L. Ed. 2d 836, 120 S. Ct. 1858 (2000).  First, a plaintiff must demonstrate an "injury in fact," which is "concrete," "distinct and palpable," and "actual or imminent."  Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155, 109 L. Ed. 2d 135, 110 S. Ct. 1717 (1990) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Second, a plaintiff must establish "a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of--the injury has to be 'fairly trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] some third party not before the court.'"  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-561, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351, 112 S. Ct. 2130 (1992) (quoting Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26, 41-42, 48 L. Ed. 2d 450, 96 S. Ct. 1917 (1976)).  [****236]  Third, a plaintiff must show the  [*226]  "'substantial likelihood' that the requested relief will remedy the alleged injury in fact."  Stevens, supra, at 771, 146 L. Ed. 2d 836, 120 S. Ct. 1858. 
[33B] As noted above, § 305 amended the Communication Act's requirements with respect to the lowest unit charge for broadcasting time.  But this price is not available to qualified candidates until 45 days before a primary election or 60 days [**708]  before a general election. Because Senator McConnell's current term does not expire until 2009, the earliest day he could be affected by § 305 is 45 days before the Republican primary election in 2008.  This alleged injury in fact is too remote temporally to satisfy Article III standing.  See Whitmore, supra, at 158, 109 L. Ed. 2d 135, 110 S. Ct. 1717 ("A threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); see also Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 102, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675, 103 S. Ct. 1660 (1983) (A plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must show he is "'immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury' as [a] result" of the challenged conduct).  Because we hold that the McConnell plaintiffs lack standing to challenge § 305, we affirm the [****237]  District Court's dismissal of the challenge to BCRA § 305. 
BCRA § 307
[35] BCRA § 307, which amends § 315(a)(1) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), 86 Stat 3, as added, 90 Stat 487, increases and indexes for inflation certain FECA contribution limits.  The Adams and Paul plaintiffs challenge § 307 in this Court.  Both groups contend that they have standing to sue.  Again, we disagree. 
The Adams plaintiffs, a group consisting of voters, organizations representing voters, and candidates, allege two injuries, and argue each is legally cognizable, "as established by case law outlawing electoral discrimination based on economic status . . . and upholding the right to an equally meaningful vote . . . ." Brief for Appellants Adams et al. in No. 02-1740, p 31. 
 [*227]  First, they assert that the increases in hard money limits enacted by § 307 deprive them of an equal ability to participate in the election process based on their economic status.  But, to satisfy our standing requirements, a plaintiff's alleged injury must be an invasion of a concrete and particularized legally protected interest.  Lujan, supra, at 560, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351, 112 S. Ct. 2130.  We have noted that "[a]lthough [****238]  standing  [***601]  in no way depends on the merits of the plaintiff's contention that particular conduct is illegal, . . . it often turns on the nature and source of the claim asserted."  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 500, 45 L. Ed. 2d 343, 95 S. Ct. 2197 (1975) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  We have never recognized a legal right comparable to the broad and diffuse injury asserted by the Adams plaintiffs.  Their reliance on this Court's voting rights cases is misplaced.  They rely on cases requiring nondiscriminatory access to the ballot and a single, equal vote for each voter. See, e.g., Lubin v. Panish, 415 U.S. 709, 39 L. Ed. 2d 702, 94 S. Ct. 1315 (1974) (invalidating a statute requiring a ballot-access fee fixed at a percentage of the salary for the office sought because it unconstitutionally burdened the right to vote); Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 666-668, 16 L. Ed. 2d 169, 86 S. Ct. 1079 (1966) (invalidating a state poll tax because it effectively denied the right to vote). 
None of these plaintiffs claims a denial of equal access to the ballot or the right to vote.  Instead, the plaintiffs allege a curtailment of the scope of their participation in the electoral process.  But we [****239]  have noted that "[p]olitical 'free trade' does not necessarily require that all who participate in the political marketplace do so with exactly equal resources."  Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U.S. 238, 257, 93 L. Ed. 2d 539, 107 S. Ct. 616 (1986); see also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 48, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612 (1976) (per curiam) (rejecting the asserted government interest of "equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome [**709]  of elections" to justify the burden on speech presented by expenditure limits).  This claim of injury by the Adams plaintiffs is, therefore, not to a legally cognizable right. 
 [*228]  Second, the Adams plaintiffs-candidates contend that they have suffered a competitive injury.  Their candidates "do not wish to solicit or accept large campaign contributions as permitted by BCRA" because "[t]hey believe such contributions create the appearance of unequal access and influence." Adams Complaint P 53.  As a result, they claim that BCRA § 307 puts them at a "fundraising disadvantage," making it more difficult for them to compete in elections. See id., P 56. 
The second claimed injury is based on the same [****240]  premise as the first: BCRA § 307's increased hard money limits allow plaintiffs-candidates' opponents to raise more money, and, consequently, the plaintiffs-candidates' ability to compete or participate in the electoral process is diminished.  But they cannot show that their alleged injury is "fairly traceable" to BCRA § 307.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351, 112 S. Ct. 2130.  Their alleged inability to compete stems not from the operation of § 307, but from their own personal "wish" not to solicit or accept large contributions, i.e., their personal choice.  Accordingly, the Adams plaintiffs fail here to allege an injury in fact that is "fairly traceable" to BCRA. 
[36] The Paul plaintiffs maintain that BCRA § 307 violates the Freedom of Press Clause of the First Amendment. They contend that their political campaigns and public interest advocacy involve traditional press activities and that, therefore, they  [***602]  are protected by the First Amendment's guarantee of the freedom of press.  The Paul plaintiffs argue that the contribution limits imposed by BCRA § 307, together with the individual and political action committee contribution limitations of FECA § 315, impose unconstitutional editorial [****241]  control upon candidates and their campaigns. The Paul plaintiffs argue that by imposing economic burdens upon them, but not upon the institutional media, see 2 USC § 431(9)(B)(i) [2 USCS § 431(9)(B)(i)] (exempting "any news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through the facilities of any broadcasting station, newspaper, magazine, or other periodical publication, unless such facilities are owned or controlled  [*229]  by any political party, political committee, or candidate" from the definition of expenditure), BCRA § 307 and FECA § 315 violate the freedom of the press. 
The Paul plaintiffs cannot show the "'substantial likelihood' that the requested relief will remedy [their] alleged injury in fact," Stevens, 529 U.S., at 771, 146 L. Ed. 2d 836, 120 S. Ct. 1858.  The relief the Paul plaintiffs seek is for this Court to strike down the contribution limits, removing the alleged disparate editorial controls and economic burdens imposed on them.  But § 307 merely increased and indexed for inflation certain FECA contribution limits.  This Court has no power to adjudicate a challenge to the FECA limits in this case because challenges to the constitutionality of FECA provisions are subject to direct review [****242]  before an appropriate en banc court of appeals, as provided in 2 USC § 437h [2 USCS § 437h], not in the three-judge District Court convened pursuant to BCRA § 403(a).  Although the Court has jurisdiction to hear a challenge to § 307, if the Court were to strike down the increases and indexes established by BCRA § 307, it would not remedy the Paul plaintiffs' alleged injury because both the limitations imposed by FECA and the exemption for news media would remain unchanged.  A ruling in the Paul plaintiffs' favor, therefore, would not redress their alleged injury, and they accordingly lack standing.  See [**710]   Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 105-110, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210, 118 S. Ct. 1003 (1998). 
For the reasons above, we affirm the District Court's dismissal of the Adams and Paul plaintiffs' challenges to BCRA § 307 for lack of standing. 
BCRA §§ 304, 316, and 319
[37] BCRA §§ 304 and 316, which amend FECA § 315, and BCRA § 319, which adds FECA § 315(a), collectively known as the "millionaire provisions," provide for a series of staggered increases in otherwise applicable contribution-to-candidate limits if the candidate's opponent spends a triggering amount  [*230]  of his [****243]  personal funds. 1  The provisions also  [***603]  eliminate the coordinated expenditure limits in certain circumstances. 2 
In their challenge to the millionaire provisions, the Adams plaintiffs allege the same injuries that they alleged with regard to BCRA § 307.  For the reasons discussed above, they fail to allege a cognizable injury that is "fairly traceable" to BCRA.  Additionally, as the District Court noted, "none of the Adams plaintiffs is a candidate in an election [****244]  affected by the millionaire provisions--i.e., one in which an opponent chooses to spend the triggering amount in his own funds--and it would be purely 'conjectural' for the court to assume that any plaintiff ever will be."  251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 431 (DC 2003) (case below) (Henderson, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351, 112 S. Ct. 2130).  We affirm the District Court's dismissal of the Adams plaintiffs' challenge to the millionaire provisions for lack of standing. 
BCRA § 311
[38] FECA § 318 requires that certain communications "authorized" by a candidate or his political committee clearly identify the candidate or committee or, if not so authorized, identify the payor and announce the lack of authorization.  2 USC § 441d (2000 ed. and Supp. II) [2 USCS § 441d].  BCRA § 311 makes several amendments to FECA § 318, among them the expansion of this identification regime to include disbursements for "electioneering communications" as defined in BCRA § 201. 
 [*231]  The McConnell and Chamber of Commerce plaintiffs challenge BCRA § 311 by simply noting that § 311, along with all of the "electioneering [****245]  communications" provisions of BCRA, is unconstitutional.  We disagree.  We think BCRA § 311's inclusion of electioneering communications in the FECA § 318 disclosure regime bears a sufficient relationship to the important governmental interest of "shed[ding] the light of publicity" on campaign financing.  Buckley, 424 U.S., at 81, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612.  Assuming as we must that FECA § 318 is valid to begin with, and that FECA § 318 is valid as amended by BCRA § 311's amendments other than the inclusion of electioneering communications, the challenged inclusion of electioneering communications is not itself unconstitutional.  We affirm the District Court's decision upholding § 311's expansion of FECA § 318(a) to include disclosure of disbursements for electioneering communications. 
 [**711]   BCRA § 318
[39A] BCRA § 318, which adds FECA § 324, prohibits individuals "17 years old or younger" from making contributions to candidates and contributions or donations to political parties. 2 USC § 441k (Supp. II) [2 USCS § 441k]. The McConnell and Echols plaintiffs challenge the provision; they argue that § 318 violates the First Amendment rights of minors.  We agree. 
[39B] [40] [41] Minors enjoy [****246]  the protection of the First Amendment. See, e.g., Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 511-513, 21 L. Ed. 2d 731, 89 S. Ct. 733 (1969).  Limitations on the amount that an individual may contribute  [***604]  to a candidate or political committee impinge on the protected freedoms of expression and association.  See Buckley, supra, at 20-22 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612.  When the Government burdens the right to contribute, we apply heightened scrutiny.  See ante, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 543-544 (joint opinion of Stevens and O'Connor, JJ.) ("[A] contribution limit involving even 'significant interference' with associational rights is nevertheless valid if it satisfies the 'lesser demand' of being 'closely drawn' to match a 'sufficiently important  [*232]  interest.'" (quoting FEC v. Beaumont, 539 U.S. 146, 162, 156 L. Ed. 2d 179, 123 S. Ct. 2200 (2003) (slip op., at 15).  We ask whether there is a "sufficiently important interest" and whether the statute is "closely drawn" to avoid unnecessary abridgment of First Amendment freedoms.  Ante, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 543-544; Buckley, 424 U.S., at 25, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612.  The Government asserts that the provision protects against corruption by conduit; that is, donations by parents through their minor [****247]  children to circumvent contribution limits applicable to the parents.  But the Government offers scant evidence of this form of evasion. 3  Perhaps the Government's slim evidence results from sufficient deterrence of such activities by § 320 of FECA, which prohibits any person from "mak[ing] a contribution in the name of another person" or "knowingly accept[ing] a contribution made by one person in the name of another," 2 USC § 441f [2 USCS § 441f].  Absent a more convincing case of the claimed evil, this interest is simply too attenuated for § 318 to withstand heightened scrutiny.  See  Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 391, 145 L. Ed. 2d 886, 120 S. Ct. 897 (2000) ("The quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments will vary up or down with the novelty and plausibility of the justification raised"). 
 [****248]  [39C] Even assuming, arguendo, the Government advances an important interest, the provision is overinclusive.  The States have adopted a variety of more tailored approaches--e.g., counting contributions by minors against the total permitted for a parent or family unit, imposing a lower cap on contributions by minors, and prohibiting contributions by very young children.  Without deciding whether any of these alternatives is sufficiently tailored, we hold that the provision here sweeps too broadly.  We therefore affirm the District Court's decision striking down § 318 as unconstitutional. 
 [*233]  BCRA § 403(b)
[42] The National Right to Life plaintiffs argue that the District Court's grant of intervention to the intervenor-defendants, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a) and BCRA § 403(b), must be reversed because the intervenor-defendants lack Article III standing.  It is clear, however, that the Federal Election Commission [**712]  (FEC) has standing, and therefore we need not address the standing of the intervenor-defendants, whose position here is identical to the FEC's.  See, e.g., Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 431-432, n. 19, 141 L. Ed. 2d 393, 118 S. Ct. 2091 (1998); Bowsher v. Synar,  [***605]  478 U.S. 714, 721, 92 L. Ed. 2d 583, 106 S. Ct. 3181 (1986). [****249]  Cf. Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54, 68-69, n. 21, 90 L. Ed. 2d 48, 106 S. Ct. 1697 (1986) (reserving the question for another day). 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court's judgment finding the plaintiffs' challenges to BCRA § 305, § 307, and the millionaire provisions nonjusticiable, striking down as unconstitutional BCRA § 318, and upholding BCRA § 311.  The judgment of the District Court is affirmed. 
Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to BCRA Title V. * 
[43A] [44A] [45A] We consider here the constitutionality of § 504 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), amending the Communications Act of 1934.  That section requires broadcasters to keep publicly available records of politically related broadcasting requests.  47 USC § 315(e) (Supp. II) [47 USCS § 315(e)].  The McConnell plaintiffs, who include the National Association of Broadcasters, argue that  [****250]  § 504 imposes onerous administrative burdens, lacks any offsetting justification, and consequently violates the First Amendment. For similar reasons, the three judges on the District Court found BCRA § 504 unconstitutional on its face.  251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 186 [*234]  (DC 2003) (per curiam) (case below).  We disagree, and we reverse that determination. 
I 
BCRA § 504's key requirements are the following: 
(1) A "candidate request" requirement calls for broadcasters to keep records of broadcast requests "made by or on behalf of" any "legally qualified candidate for public office." 47 USC § 315(e)(1)(A) (Supp. II) [47 USCS § 315(e)(1)(A)]. 
(2) An "election message request" requirement calls for broadcasters to keep records of requests (made by anyone) to broadcast "message[s]" that refer either to a "legally qualified candidate" or to "any election to Federal office." §§ 315(e)(1)(B)(i), (ii). 
(3) An "issue request" requirement calls for broadcasters to keep records of requests (made by anyone) to broadcast "message[s]" related to a "national legislative issue of public importance," § 315(e)(1)(B)(iii), or otherwise relating to a "political matter of national importance,  [****251]  " § 315(e)(1)(B). 
We shall consider each provision in turn. 
II 
[43B] BCRA § 504's "candidate request" requirements are virtually identical to those contained in a regulation that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) promulgated as early as 1938 and which with slight modifications the FCC has maintained in effect ever since.  47 CFR § 73.1943 (2002); compare  3 Fed. Reg. 1692 (47 CFR § 36a4);  13 Fed. Reg. 7486 (1948) (47 CFR §§ 3.190(d), 3.290(d), 3.690(d)); 17 Fed. Reg. 4711 (1952) (47 CFR § 3.590(d)); [**713]   19 Fed. Reg.  5949 (1954); 23 Fed. Reg. 7817 (1958); 28 Fed. Reg. 13593 (1963) (47 CFR § 73.120(d)); 43 Fed. Reg. 32795 (1978) (47 CFR § 73.1940(d)); 57  [***606]  Fed. Reg. 210 (1992) (47 CFR § 73.1943).  See generally Brief in Opposition to Motion of Appellee National Association of Broadcasters for Summary  [*235]  Affirmance in No. 02-1676, pp 9-10 (hereinafter Brief Opposing Summary Affirmance). 
In its current form the FCC regulation requires broadcast licensees to "keep" a publicly available file "of all requests for broadcast time made by or on behalf of a candidate for public [****252]  office," along with a notation showing whether the request was granted, and (if granted) a history that includes "classes of time," "rates charged," and when the "spots actually aired." 47 CFR § 73.1943(a) (2002); § 76.1701(a) (same for cable systems).  These regulation-imposed requirements mirror the statutory requirements imposed by BCRA § 504 with minor differences which no one here challenges.  Compare 47 CFR § 73.1943 with 47 USC § 315(e)(2) (Supp. II) [47 USCS § 315(e)(2)] (see Appendix, infra). 
The McConnell plaintiffs argue that these requirements are "intolerabl[y]" "burdensome and invasive." Brief for Appellants/Cross-Appellees Senator Mitch McConnell et al. in No. 02-1674 et al., p 74 (hereinafter Brief for McConnell Plaintiffs).  But we do not see how that could be so.  The FCC has consistently estimated that its "candidate request" regulation imposes upon each licensee an additional administrative burden of six to seven hours of work per year.  See 66 Fed. Reg. 37468 (2001); id., at 18090; 63 Fed. Reg. 26593 (1998); id., at 10379; 57 Fed. Reg. 18492 (1992); see also 66 Fed. Reg. 29962 (2001) (total annual burden [****253]  of one hour per cable system).  That burden means annual costs of a few hundred dollars at most, a microscopic amount compared to the many millions of dollars of revenue broadcasters receive from candidates who wish to advertise. 
Perhaps for this reason, broadcasters in the past did not strongly oppose the regulation or its extension.  Cf., e.g., 17 Fed. Reg. 4711 (1952) ("No comments adverse to the adoption of the proposed rule have been received"); 43 Fed. Reg. 32794 (1978) (no adverse comments).  Indeed in 1992, "CBS" itself "suggest[ed]" that the candidate file "include a record of all requests for time."  57 Fed. Reg. 206 (1992); cf. 63 Fed. Reg. 49493 [*236]  (1998) (FCC "not persuaded that the current retention period [two years] is overly burdensome to licensees"). 
In any event, as the FCC wrote in an analogous context, broadcaster recordkeeping requirements "'simply run with the territory.'"  40 Fed. Reg. 18398 (1975).  Broadcasters must keep and make publicly available numerous records.  See 47 CFR § 73.3526 (2002) (general description of select recordkeeping requirements for commercial stations); see also §§ 73.1202,  [****254]  73.3526(e)(9)(i) (retention of all "written comments and suggestions [including letters and e-mail] received from the public regarding operation of the station" for three years); § 73.1212(e) (sponsorship identification records, including the identification of a sponsoring entity's executive officers and board-level members when sponsoring "political matter or matter involving the discussion of a controversial issue of public importance"); § 73.1840 (retention of station logs); § 73.1942 (candidate broadcast records); § 73.2080 (equal employment opportunities records); §§ 73.3526(e)(11)(i), (e)(12) ("list of programs that have provided the station's most significant  [***607]  treatment of community issues during the preceding three month period," including "brief narrative describing [the issues, and] time, date, duration, and title"); §§ 73.3526(e)(11)(ii), (iii) (reports [**714]  of children's program, and retention of records sufficient to substantiate "compliance with the commercial limits on children's programming"); § 73.3613(a) (network affiliation contracts); §§ 73.3613(b), 73.3615, 73.3526(e)(5) (ownership-related reports); § 73.3613(c) ("[m]anagement consultant agreements"); § 73.3613(d)  [****255]  ("[t]ime brokerage agreements").  Compared to these longstanding recordkeeping requirements, an additional six to seven hours is a small drop in a very large bucket. 
The McConnell plaintiffs also claim that the "candidate requests" requirement fails significantly to further any important governmental interest.  Brief for McConnell Plaintiffs 74.  But, again, we cannot agree.  The FCC has pointed out  [*237]  that "[t]hese records are necessary to permit political candidates and others to verify that licensees have complied with their obligations relating to use of their facilities by candidates for political office" pursuant to the "equal time" provision of 47 USC § 315(a) [47 USCS § 315(a)].  63 Fed. Reg. 49493 (1998).  They also help the FCC determine whether broadcasters have violated their obligation to sell candidates time at the "lowest unit charge." 47 USC § 315(b) [47 USCS § 315(b)].  As reinforced by BCRA, the "candidate request" requirements will help the FCC, the Federal Election Commission, and "the public to evaluate whether broadcasters are processing [candidate] requests in an evenhanded fashion," Brief Opposing Summary Affirmance 9, thereby helping to assure [****256]  broadcasting fairness.  47 USC § 315(a) [47 USCS § 315(a)];  Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 390, 23 L. Ed. 2d 371, 89 S. Ct. 1794 (1969).  They will help make the public aware of how much money candidates may be prepared to spend on broadcast messages. 2 USC § 434 (2000 ed. and Supp. II) [2 USCS § 434]; see ante, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 580-583 (joint opinion of Stevens and O'Connor, JJ.) (hereinafter joint opinion).  And they will provide an independently compiled set of data for purposes of verifying candidates' compliance with the disclosure requirements and source limitations of BCRA and the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971.  2 USC § 434 [2 USCS § 434]; cf. Adventure Communications, Inc. v. Kentucky Registry of Election Finance, 191 F.3d 429, 433 (CA4 1999) (candidate compliance verification); 63 Fed. Reg. 49493 (1998) (FCC finding record retention provision provides public with "necessary and adequate access"). 
We note, too, that the FCC's regulatory authority is broad.  Red Lion, supra, at 380, 23 L. Ed. 2d 371, 89 S. Ct. 1794 ("broad" mandate to assure broadcasters operate in public interest); National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190, 219, 87 L. Ed. 1344, 63 S. Ct. 997 (1943) [****257]  (same).  And we have previously found broad governmental authority for agency information demands from regulated entities.  Compare United States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U.S. 632, 642-643, 94 L. Ed. 401, 70 S. Ct. 357, 46 F.T.C. 1436 (1950); Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, 327 U.S. 186, 209,  [*238]  90 L. Ed. 614, 66 S. Ct. 494 (1946); Donovan v. Lone Steer, Inc., 464 U.S. 408, 414-415,  [***608]  78 L. Ed. 2d 567, 104 S. Ct. 769 (1984). 
The Chief Justice suggests that the Government has not made these particular claims.  But it has--though succinctly--for it has cross-referenced the relevant regulatory rules.  Compare post, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 684-685 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.), with Brief Opposing Summary Affirmance; Brief for McConnell Plaintiffs 73-74; Brief for FEC et al. in No. 02-1674 et al., pp 132-133.  And succinctness through cross-reference was necessary given our procedural requirement that the Government set forth in a 140-page brief all its arguments concerning each of the 20 BCRA provisions here under contest.  251 F. Supp. 2d, at 186-188. 
 [**715]  In sum, given the Government's reference to the 65-year-old FCC regulation and the related considerations we have mentioned, we cannot accept the argument that the constitutionality [****258]  of the "candidate request" provision lacks evidentiary support.  The challengers have made no attempt to explain away the FCC's own contrary conclusions and the mass of evidence in related FCC records and proceedings.  E.g., 57 Fed. Reg. 189 (1992); cf. supra, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 605-606; ante, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 598-599 (joint opinion) (upholding BCRA's coordination provision based, in part, on prior experience under similar provision).  Because we cannot, on the present record, find the longstanding FCC regulation unconstitutional, we likewise cannot strike down the "candidate request" provision in BCRA § 504; for the latter simply embodies the regulation in a statute, thereby blocking any agency attempt to repeal it. 
III 
[44B] BCRA § 504's "election message request" requirements call for broadcasters to keep records of requests (made by any member of the public) to broadcast a "message" about "a legally qualified candidate" or "any election to Federal office." 47 USC §§ 315(e)(1)(B)(i), (ii) (Supp. II) [47 USCS §§ 315(e)(1)(B)(i), (ii)].  Although these requirements are somewhat broader than the [*239]  "candidate request" requirement, they serve much the same purposes.  A candidate's supporters or opponents account [****259]  for many of the requests to broadcast "message[s]" about a "candidate." Requests to broadcast messages about an "election" may include messages that favor one candidate or another, along with other messages that may be more neutral. 
Given the nature of many of the messages, recordkeeping can help both the regulatory agencies and the public evaluate broadcasting fairness, and determine the amount of money that individuals or groups, supporters or opponents, intend to spend to help elect a particular candidate. Cf. ante, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 587-588 (joint opinion) (upholding stringent restrictions on all election-time advertising that refers to a candidate because such advertising will often convey message of support or opposition).  Insofar as the request is to broadcast neutral material about a candidate or election, the disclosure can help the FCC carry out other statutory functions, for example, determining whether a broadcasting station is fulfilling its licensing obligation to  [***609]  broadcast material important to the community and the public.  47 USC § 315(a) [47 USCS § 315(a)] ("obligation . . . to afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on issues of public [****260]  importance"); 47 CFR § 73.1910 (2002); §§ 73.3526(e)(11)(i), (e)(12) (recordkeeping requirements for issues important to the community). 
For reasons previously discussed, supra, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 606-607, and on the basis of the material presented, we cannot say that these requirements will impose disproportionate administrative burdens.  They ask the broadcaster to keep information about the disposition of the request, and information identifying the individual or company requesting the broadcast time (name, address, contact information, or, if the requester is not an individual, the names of company officials).  47 USC § 315(e)(2) (Supp. II) [47 USCS § 315(e)(2)].  Insofar as the "request" is made by a candidate's "supporters," the "candidate request" regulation apparently already requires broadcasters  [*240]  to keep such records.  43 Fed. Reg. 32794 (1978).  Regardless, the information should prove readily available, for the individual requesting a broadcast must provide it to the broadcaster should the broadcaster accept the request.  47 CFR § 73.1212(e) (2002).  And as we have previously pointed out, the recordkeeping requirements do not reach  [**716] significantly beyond other FCC recordkeeping [****261]  rules, for example, those requiring broadcasting licensees to keep material showing compliance with their license-related promises to broadcast material on issues of public importance. See, e.g., §§ 73.3526(e)(11)(i), (e)(12) (recordkeeping requirements for issues important to the community); supra, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 606-607 (collecting regulations); Office of Communication of United Church of Christ v. FCC, 228 U.S. App. D.C. 8, 707 F.2d 1413, 1421-1422 (CADC 1983) (describing FCC rules, in force during 1960-1981, that required nonentertainment programming in 14 specific areas and mandated publicly available records detailing date, time, source, and description to substantiate compliance).  If, as we have held, the "candidate request" requirements are constitutional, supra, at ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 607-608, the "election message" requirements, which serve similar governmental interests and impose only a small incremental burden, must be constitutional as well. 
IV 
[45B] The "issue request" requirements call for broadcasters to keep records of requests (made by any member of the public) to broadcast "message[s]" about "a national legislative issue of public importance" or "any political matter of national importance." 47 USC §§ 315(e)(1)(B),  [****262]  (e)(1)(B)(iii) (Supp. II) [47 USCS §§ 315(e)(1)(B), (e)(1)(B)(iii)].  These recordkeeping requirements seem likely to help the FCC determine whether broadcasters are carrying out their "obligations to afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on issues of public importance," 47 CFR § 73.1910 (2002), and whether broadcasters are too heavily favoring entertainment, and discriminating  [*241]  against broadcasts devoted to public affairs, see ibid.; 47 USC § 315(a) [47 USCS § 315(a)]; Red Lion, 395 U.S., at 380, 23 L. Ed. 2d 371, 89 S. Ct. 1794. 
The McConnell plaintiffs claim  [***610]  that the statutory language--"political matter of national importance" or "national legislative issue of public importance"--is unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.  Brief for McConnell Plaintiffs 74-75.  But that language is no more general than the language that Congress has used to impose other obligations upon broadcasters. Compare 47 USC § 315(e)(1)(B) (Supp. II) [47 USCS § 315(e)(1)(B)] ("political matter of national importance") and § 315(e)(1)(B)(iii) ("national legislative issue of public importance") (both added by BCRA § 504), with 47 USC § 315(a) [47 USCS § 315(a)] ("obligation . . . to operate in [****263]  the public interest" and to afford reasonable opportunity for discussion of "issues of public importance"); § 317(a)(2) (FCC disclosure requirements relating to any "political program" or "discussion of any controversial issue"); cf. 47 CFR § 73.1212(e) (2002) ("political matter or . . . a controversial issue of public importance") and 9 Fed. Reg. 14734 (1944) ("public controversial issues"); ante, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 598-599 (joint opinion) (noting that the experience under longstanding regulations undermines claims of chilling effect).  And that language is also roughly comparable to other language in BCRA that we uphold today.  E.g., ante, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 564-565, and n 64 (joint opinion) (upholding 2 USC § 431(20)(A)(iii) (Supp. II) [2 USCS § 431(20)(A)(iii)] ("public communication that refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office . . . and that promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or attacks or opposes a candidate for that office")), ante, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 598-599 (upholding 2 USC § 441a(a)(7)(B)(ii) (Supp. II) [2 USCS § 441a(a)(7)(B)(ii)] (counting as coordinated disbursements that are made "in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or [****264]  suggestion of [a political party]") against challenge and noting that an "agreement" is not necessary for precision). 
 [**717]  Whether these requirements impose disproportionate administrative burdens is more difficult to say.  On the one  [*242]  hand, the burdens are likely less heavy than many that other FCC regulations have imposed, for example, the burden of keeping and disclosing "[a]ll written comments and suggestions" received from the public, including every e-mail.  47 CFR §§ 73.1202, 73.3526(e)(9) (2002); see also supra, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 606-607.  On the other hand, the burdens are likely heavier than those imposed by BCRA § 504's other provisions, previously discussed. 
[45C] [46A] The regulatory burden, in practice, will depend on how the FCC interprets and applies this provision.  The FCC has adequate legal authority to write regulations that may limit, and make more specific, the provision's potential linguistic reach.  47 USC § 315(d) [47 USCS § 315(d)].  It has often ameliorated regulatory burdens by interpretation in the past, and there is no reason to believe it will not do so here.  See 14 FCC Rcd. 4653, P25 (1999) (relaxing the recordkeeping requirements in respect to cable systems that serve [****265]  fewer than 5,000 subscribers); 14 FCC Rcd. 11113, 11121, PP20-22 (1999) (requiring candidates to inspect the political file at a station rather than requiring licensees to send out photocopies of the files to candidates upon telephone request).  The parties remain  [***611]  free to challenge the provisions, as interpreted by the FCC in regulations, or as otherwise applied.  Any such challenge will likely provide greater information about the provisions' justifications and administrative burdens.  Without that additional information, we cannot now say that the burdens are so great, or the justifications so minimal, as to warrant finding the provisions unconstitutional on their face. 
[45D] The McConnell plaintiffs and The Chief Justice make one final claim.  They say that the "issue request" requirement will force them to disclose information that will reveal their political strategies to opponents, perhaps prior to a broadcast. See post, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 686-687 (dissenting opinion).  We are willing to assume that the Constitution includes some form of protection against premature disclosure of campaign strategy--though,  [*243]  given the First Amendment interest in free and open discussion of campaign issues, we [****266]  make this assumption purely for argument's sake.  Nonetheless, even on that assumption we do not see how BCRA § 504 can be unconstitutional on its face. 
[45E] [46B] For one thing, the statute requires disclosure of names, addresses, and the fact of a request; it does not require disclosure of substantive campaign content.  See 47 USC § 315(e)(2) (Supp. II) [47 USCS § 315(e)(2)].  For another, the statutory words "as soon as possible," § 315(e)(3), would seem to permit FCC disclosure-timing rules that would avoid any premature disclosure that the Constitution itself would forbid.  Further, the plaintiffs do not point to--and our own research cannot find--any specific indication of such a "strategy-disclosure" problem arising during the past 65 years in respect to the existing FCC "candidate request" requirement, where the strategic problem might be expected to be more acute.  Finally, we today reject an analogous facial attack--premised on speculations of "advance disclosure"--on a similar BCRA provision.  See ante, at ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 584 (joint opinion).  Thus, the "strategy disclosure" argument does not show that BCRA § 504 is unconstitutional on its face, but the plaintiffs remain free to raise [****267]  this argument when § 504 is applied. 
V 
[45F] The Chief Justice makes two important arguments in response to those we have set forth.  First, he says that we "approac[h] § 504 almost exclusively from [**718]  the perspective of the broadcast licensees, ignoring the interests of candidates and other purchasers, whose speech and association rights are affected."  Post, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 684 (dissenting opinion).  The Chief Justice is certainly correct in emphasizing the importance of the speech interests of candidates and other potential speakers, but we have not ignored their First Amendment "perspective." 
 [*244]  To the contrary, we have discussed the speakers' interests together with the broadcasters' interests because the two sets of interests substantially overlap.  For example, the speakers' vagueness argument is no different from the broadcasters', and it fails for the same reasons, e.g., the fact that BCRA § 504's language is just as definite and precise as other language that we today uphold.  See supra, at ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 609-610. 
We have separately discussed the  [***612]  one and only speech-related claim advanced on behalf of candidates (or other speakers) that differs from the claims set forth by the broadcasters. See supra, [****268]  at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 610-611.  This is the claim that the statute's disclosure requirements will require candidates to reveal their political strategies to opponents.  We just said, and we now repeat, that BCRA § 504 can be applied, in a significant number of cases, without requiring any such political-strategy disclosure--either because disclosure in many cases will not create any such risk or because the FCC may promulgate rules requiring disclosure only after any such risk disappears, or both. 
[46C] Moreover, candidates (or other speakers) whom § 504 affects adversely in this way (or in other ways) remain free to challenge the lawfulness of FCC implementing regulations and to challenge the constitutionality of § 504 as applied.  To find that the speech-related interests of candidates and others may be vindicated in an as-applied challenge is not to "ignor[e]" those interests. 
Second, the Chief Justice says that "the Government, in its brief, proffers no interest whatever to support § 504 as a whole," adding that the existence of "pre-existing unchallenged agency regulations imposing similar disclosure requirements" cannot "compel the conclusion that § 504 is constitutional," nor somehow "relieve the [****269]  Government of its burden of advancing a constitutionally sufficient justification for § 504." Post, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 684-685 (dissenting opinion). 
[47] Again the Chief Justice is correct in saying that the mere existence of similar FCC regulation-imposed requirements--even  [*245]  if unchallenged for at least 65 years--cannot prove that those requirements are constitutional.  But the existence of those regulations means that we must read beyond the briefs in this case before holding those requirements unconstitutional.  Before evaluating the relevant burdens and justifications, we must at least become acquainted with the FCC's own view of the matter.  We must follow the Government's regulation-related references to the relevant regulatory records, related FCC regulatory conclusions, and the FCC's enforcement experience.  We must take into account, for example, the likelihood that the reason there is "nothing in the record that indicates licensees have treated purchasers unfairly," post, at ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 684-685 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting), is that for many decades similar FCC regulations have made that unfair treatment unlawful.  And, if we are to avoid disrupting related agency law, we must evaluate what we [****270]  find in agency records and related experience before holding this similar statutory provision unconstitutional on its face. 
Even a superficial examination of those relevant agency materials reveals strong supporting justifications, and a lack of significant [**719]  administrative burdens.  And any additional burden that the statute, viewed facially, imposes upon interests protected by the First Amendment seems slight compared to the strong enforcement-related interests that it serves.  Given the FCC regulations and their history, the statutory requirements must survive a facial attack under any potentially applicable First Amendment standard,  [***613]  including that of heightened scrutiny. 
That is why the regulations are relevant.  That is why the brevity of the Government's discussion here cannot be determinative.  That is why we fear that The Chief Justice's contrary view would lead us into an unfortunate--and at present unjustified--revolution in communications law.  And that is why we disagree with his dissent. 
 [*246]  The portion of the judgment of the District Court invalidating BCRA § 504 is reversed. 
It is so ordered. 
APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT 
Title 47 USC § 315(e) (Supp. II) [****271]  [47 USCS § 315(e)], as amended by BCRA § 504, provides:

"(i) a legally qualified candidate; 
"(ii) any election to Federal office; or 
"(iii) a national legislative issue of public importance. 
"(2) Contents of record 
"A record maintained under paragraph (1) shall contain information regarding-- 
"(A) whether the request to purchase broadcast time is accepted or rejected by the licensee; 
"(B) the rate charged for the broadcast time;

Although I join Justice Kennedy's opinion in full, I write separately to highlight my disagreement with the Court on Title I of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), 116 Stat 81, and to dissent  [***679]  from the Court's opinion upholding § 504 of Title V. 
I 
The issue presented by Title I is not, as the Court implies, whether Congress can permissibly regulate campaign contributions to candidates, [****274]  de facto or otherwise, or seek to eliminate corruption in the political process.  Rather, the issue is whether Congress can permissibly regulate much speech that has no plausible connection to [**778]  candidate contributions or corruption to achieve those goals.  Under our precedent,  [*351]  restrictions on political contributions implicate important First Amendment values and are constitutional only if they are "closely drawn" to reduce the corruption of federal candidates or the appearance of corruption.  Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 26- 27 , 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612(1976) (per curiam). Yet, the Court glosses over the breadth of the restrictions, characterizing Title I of BCRA as "do[ing] little more that regulat[ing] the ability of wealthy individuals, corporations, and unions to contribute large sums of money to influence federal elections, federal candidates, and federal officeholders."  Ante, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 545 (joint opinion of Stevens and O'Connor, JJ.).  Because, in reality, Title I is much broader than the Court allows, regulating a good deal of speech that does not have the potential to corrupt federal candidates and officeholders, I dissent. 
The lynchpin of Title I, new FECA § 323(a), prohibits [****275]  national political party committees from "solicit[ing]," "receiv[ing]," "direct[ing] to another person," and "spend[ing]" any funds not subject to federal regulation, even if those funds are used for nonelection related activities.  2 USC § 441i(a)(1) (Supp. II) [2 USCS § 441i(a)(1)].  The Court concludes that such a restriction is justified because under FECA, "donors have been free to contribute substantial sums of soft money to the national parties, which the parties can spend for the specific purpose of influencing a particular candidate's federal election."  Ante, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 549-550.  Accordingly, "[i]t is not only plausible, but likely, that candidates would feel grateful for such donations and that donors would seek to exploit that gratitude." Ibid. But the Court misses the point.  Certainly "infusions of money into [candidates'] campaigns," Federal Election Comm'n v. National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U.S. 480, 497, 84 L. Ed. 2d 455, 105 S. Ct. 1459 (1985), can be regulated, but § 323(a) does not regulate only donations given to influence a particular federal election; it regulates all donations to national political committees, no matter the use to which the funds are put.  [****276]  
The Court attempts to sidestep the unprecedented breadth of this regulation by stating that the "close relationship between  [*352]  federal officeholders and the national parties" makes all donations to the national parties "suspect."  Ante, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 555.  But a close association with others, especially in the realm of political speech, is not a surrogate for corruption; it is one of our most treasured First Amendment rights.  See  California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 574, 147 L. Ed. 2d 502, 120 S. Ct. 2402 (2000);  Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 225, 103 L. Ed. 2d 271, 109 S. Ct. 1013 (1989); Tashjian v. Republican Party of  [***680]  Conn., 479 U.S. 208, 214, 93 L. Ed. 2d 514, 107 S. Ct. 544 (1986).  The Court's willingness to impute corruption on the basis of a relationship greatly infringes associational rights and expands Congress' ability to regulate political speech. And there is nothing in the Court's analysis that limits congressional regulation to national political parties. In fact, the Court relies in part on this closeness rationale to regulate nonprofit organizations.  Ante, at ____ - ____, n 51,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 556-557.  Who knows what association will be deemed too close to federal officeholders next.  When a [****277]  donation to an organization has no potential to corrupt a federal officeholder, the relationship between the officeholder and the organization is simply irrelevant. 
The Court fails to recognize that the national political parties are exemplars of political speech at all levels of government, in addition to effective fundraisers for federal candidates and officeholders. For sure, national political party committees [**779]  exist in large part to elect federal candidates, but as a majority of the District Court found, they also promote coordinated political messages and participate in public policy debates unrelated to federal elections, promote, even in off-year elections, state and local candidates and seek to influence policy at those levels, and increase public participation in the electoral process.  See 251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 334-337 (DC 2003) (per curiam) (Henderson, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); id., at 820-821 (Leon, J.).  Indeed, some national political parties exist primarily for the purpose of expressing ideas and generating debate.  App. 185-186 [*353]  (declaration of Stephen L. Dasbach et al. P 11 (describing Libertarian Party)). 
As these [****278]  activities illustrate, political parties often foster speech crucial to a healthy democracy, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 820 (Leon, J.), and fulfill the need for like-minded individuals to ban together and promote a political philosophy, see Jones, supra, at 574, 147 L. Ed. 2d 502, 120 S. Ct. 2402; Eu, supra, at 225, 103 L. Ed. 2d 271, 109 S. Ct. 1013.  When political parties engage in pure political speech that has little or no potential to corrupt their federal candidates and officeholders, the government cannot constitutionally burden their speech any more than it could burden the speech of individuals engaging in these same activities.  E.g.,  National Conservative Political Action Comm., supra, at 496-497, 84 L. Ed. 2d 455, 105 S. Ct. 1459; Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290, 297-298, 70 L. Ed. 2d 492, 102 S. Ct. 434 (1981); Buckley, 424 U.S., at 27, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612.  Notwithstanding the Court's citation to the numerous abuses of FECA, under any definition of "exacting scrutiny," the means chosen by Congress, restricting all donations to national parties no matter the purpose for which they are given or are used, are not "closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms," id., at 25, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612 . [****279]  
BCRA's overinclusiveness is not limited to national political parties. To prevent the circumvention of the ban on the national parties' use of nonfederal funds, BCRA extensively regulates state parties, primarily state elections, and state candidates. For example, new FECA § 323(b), by reference to new FECA §§ 301(20)(A)(i)-(ii), prohibits state parties  [***681]  from using nonfederal funds 1  for general partybuilding activities such as voter registration, voter identification, and get out the vote for state candidates even if federal candidates are not mentioned.  See 2 USC §§ 441i(b), 431(20)(A)(i)-(ii) (Supp. II) [2 USCS §§ 441i(b), 431(20)(A)(i)-(ii)].  New FECA § 323(d) prohibits  [*354]  state and local political party committees, like their national counterparts, from soliciting and donating "any funds" to nonprofit organizations such as the National Rifle Association or the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).  See 2 USC § 441i(d) [2 USCS § 441i(d)].  And, new FECA § 323(f) requires a state gubernatorial candidate to abide by federal funding restrictions when airing a television ad that tells voters that, if elected, he would oppose the President's policy of increased [****280]  oil and gas exploration within the State because it would harm the environment.  See 2 USC §§ 441i(f), 431(20)(A)(iii) [2 USCS §§ 441i(f), 431(20)(A)(iii)] (regulating "public communication[s] that refe[r] to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office (regardless of whether a candidate for State or local office is also mentioned  [**780] or identified) and that . . . attacks or opposes a candidate for that office"). 
Although these provisions are more focused on activities that may affect federal elections, there is scant evidence in the record to indicate that federal candidates or officeholders are corrupted or would appear corrupted by donations for these activities.  See 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 403, 407, 416, 422 (Henderson, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part);  [****281]   id., at 779-780, 791 (Leon, J.); see also Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 518 U.S. 604, 616, 135 L. Ed. 2d 795, 116 S. Ct. 2309 (1996) (plurality opinion) (noting that "the opportunity for corruption posed by [nonfederal contributions for state elections, get-out-the-vote, and voter registration activities] is, at best, attenuated").  Nonetheless, the Court concludes that because these activities benefit federal candidates and officeholders, see ante, at ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 563-564, or prevent the circumvention of pre-existing or contemporaneously enacted restrictions, 2  see ante, at ____, ____, ____, ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 562, 567, 570, 574,  [*355]  it must defer to the "'predictive judgments of Congress,'" ante, at ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 562 (quoting Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 665, 129 L. Ed. 2d 497, 114 S. Ct. 2445 (1994)). 
 [****282]  Yet the Court cannot truly mean what it says.  Newspaper editorials and political talk shows benefit federal candidates and officeholders every bit as much as a generic voter registration drive conducted by a  [***682]  state party; there is little doubt that the endorsement of a major newspaper affects federal elections, and federal candidates and officeholders are surely "grateful," ante, at ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 564, for positive media coverage.  I doubt, however, the Court would seriously contend that we must defer to Congress' judgment if it chose to reduce the influence of political endorsements in federal elections. 3  See Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241, 247, 250, 41 L. Ed. 2d 730, 94 S. Ct. 2831 (1974) (holding unconstitutional a state law that required newspapers to provide "right to reply" to any candidate who was personally or professionally assailed in order to eliminate the "abuses of bias and manipulative reportage" by the press). 
 [****283]  It is also true that any circumvention rationale ultimately must rest on the circumvention itself leading to the corruption of federal candidates and officeholders. See Buckley, 424 U.S., at 38, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612 (upholding restrictions on funds donated to national  [*356]  political parties "for the purpose of influencing any election for a Federal office" because they were prophylactic measures designed "to prevent evasion" of the contribution limit on candidates).  All [**781]  political speech that is not sifted through federal regulation circumvents the regulatory scheme to some degree or another, and thus by the Court's standard would be a "loophole" in the current system. 4  Unless the Court would uphold federal regulation of all funding of political speech, a rationale dependent on circumvention alone will not do.  By untethering its inquiry from corruption or the appearance of corruption, the Court has removed the touchstone of our campaign finance precedent and has failed to replace it with any logical limiting principle. 
 [****284]  But such an untethering is necessary to the Court's analysis.  Only by using amorphous language to conclude a federal interest, however vaguely defined, exists can the Court avoid the obvious fact that new FECA §§ 323(a), (b), (d), and (f ) are vastly overinclusive.  Any campaign finance law aimed at reducing corruption will almost surely affect federal elections or prohibit the circumvention of federal law, and if broad enough, most laws will generally  [***683]  reduce some appearance of corruption. Indeed, it is precisely because  [*357]  broad laws are likely to nominally further a legitimate interest that we require Congress to tailor its restrictions; requiring all federal candidates to self-finance their campaigns would surely reduce the appearance of donor corruption, but it would hardly be constitutional.  In allowing Congress to rely on general principles such as affecting a federal election or prohibiting the circumvention of existing law, the Court all but eliminates the "closely drawn" tailoring requirement and meaningful judicial review. 
No doubt Congress was convinced by the many abuses of the current system that something in this area must be done.  Its response, however, was too blunt.  [****285]  Many of the abuses described by the Court involve donations that were made for the "purpose of influencing a federal election," and thus are already regulated.  See Buckley, supra. Congress could have sought to have the existing restrictions enforced or to enact other restrictions that are "closely drawn" to its legitimate concerns.  But it should not be able to broadly restrict political speech in the fashion it has chosen.  Today's decision, by not requiring tailored restrictions, has significantly reduced the protection for political speech having little or nothing to do with corruption or the appearance of corruption. 
II 
BCRA § 504 amends § 315 of the Communications Act to require broadcast licensees to maintain and disclose records of any request to purchase broadcast time that "is made by or on behalf of a legally qualified candidate for public office" or that "communicates a message relating to any political matter of national importance," including communications relating to "a legally qualified candidate," "any election to Federal office," and "a national legislative issue of public importance."  [**782]   BCRA § 504;  [****286]  47 USC § 315(e)(1) (Supp.  II) [47 USCS § 315(e)(1)]. 5   [*358]  This section differs from other BCRA disclosure sections because it requires broadcast licensees to disclose requests to purchase broadcast time  [***684]  rather than requiring purchasers to disclose their disbursements for broadcast time.  See, e.g., BCRA § 201.  The Court concludes that § 504 "must survive a facial attack under any potentially applicable [*359]  First Amendment standard, including that of heightened scrutiny."  Ante, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 612-613 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  I disagree. 
 [****287]  This section is deficient because of the absence of a sufficient governmental interest to justify disclosure of mere requests to purchase broadcast time, as well as purchases themselves.  The Court approaches § 504 almost exclusively from the perspective of the broadcast licensees, ignoring the interests of candidates and other purchasers, whose speech and association rights are affected by § 504.  See, e.g., ante, at ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 606 (noting that broadcasters are subject to numerous recordkeeping requirements); ante, at ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 607 (opining that this Court has recognized "broad governmental authority for agency information demands from regulated entities"); ante, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 608-609 ("[W]e cannot say that these requirements will impose disproportionate administrative burdens").  An approach that simply focuses on whether the administrative burden is justifiable is untenable.  Because § 504 impinges on core First Amendment rights, it is subject to a more demanding test than mere rational-basis review.  The Court applies the latter by asking essentially whether there is any conceivable reason to support § 504.  See ante, at ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 608 (discussing the ways in which the disclosure "can help" the FCC and the public);  [****288]  ante, at ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 609 (noting that the "recordkeeping requirements seem likely to help the FCC" enforce the fairness doctrine). 
Required disclosure provisions that deter constitutionally protected association and speech rights are subject to heightened [**783]  scrutiny.  See Buckley, 424 U.S., at 64, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612.  When applying heightened scrutiny, we first ask whether the Government has asserted an interest sufficient to justify the disclosure of requests to purchase broadcast time.  Ibid.; see ante, at ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 581 (joint opinion of Stevens and O'Connor, JJ.) (concluding that the important state interests the Buckley Court held justified FECA's disclosure requirements apply to BCRA § 201's disclosure requirement).  But the Government,  [*360]  in its brief, proffers no interest whatever to support § 504 as a whole. 
Contrary to the Court's suggestion, ante, at ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 608 (opinion of Breyer, J.), the Government's brief does not succinctly present interests sufficient to support § 504.  The two paragraphs that the Court relies on provide the following: 
"As explained in the government's brief in opposition to the  [***685]  motion for summary affirmance on this issue filed by plaintiff National Association of [****289]  Broadcasters (NAB), longstanding FCC regulations impose disclosure requirements with respect to the sponsorship of broadcast matter 'involving the discussion of a controversial issue of public importance.' 47 C. F. R. 73.1212(d) and (e) (2002); see 47 C. F. R. 76.1701(d) (2002) (same standard used in disclosure regulation governing cablecasting).  By enabling viewers and listeners to identify the persons actually responsible for communications aimed at a mass audience, those regulations assist the public in evaluating the message transmitted.  See Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 792 n. 32 [55 L. Ed. 2d 707, 98 S. Ct. 1407] ('Identification of the source of advertising may be required . . . so that the people will be able to evaluate the arguments to which they are being subjected.'). 
"The range of information required to be disclosed under BCRA § 504 is comparable to the disclosures mandated by pre-existing FCC rules.  Compare 47 USC 315(e)(2)(G) [47 USCS § 315(e)(2)(G)] (added by BCRA § 504), with 47 C. F. R. 73.1212(e) and 76.1701(d) (2002).  Plaintiffs do not attempt to show that BCRA § 504's requirements are more onerous than the FCC's longstanding rules, nor do they contend that the pre-existing agency regulations [****290]  are themselves unconstitutional.  See generally 02-1676 Gov't Br. in Opp. to Mot. of NAB for Summ. Aff. 4-9.  Because BCRA § 504 is essentially a codification of established and unchallenged regulatory requirements,  [*361]  plaintiffs' First Amendment claim should be rejected." Brief for FEC et al. in No. 02-1674 et al., pp 132-133; ante, at ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 608.
While these paragraphs attempt to set forth a justification for the new Communications Act § 315(e)(1)(B), discussed below, I fail to see any justification for BCRA § 504 in its entirety.  Nor do I find persuasive the Court's and the Government's argument that pre-existing unchallenged agency regulations imposing similar disclosure requirements compel the conclusion that § 504 is constitutional and somehow relieve the Government of its burden of advancing a constitutionally sufficient justification for § 504. 
At oral argument, the Government counsel indicated that one of the interests supporting § 504 in its entirety stems from the fairness doctrine, Tr. of Oral Arg. 192, which in general imposes an obligation on licensees to devote a "reasonable percentage" of broadcast time to issues of public importance in a way that reflects opposing [****291]  views.  See Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 23 L. Ed. 2d 371, 89 S. Ct. 1794 (1969).  Assuming, arguendo, this latter-day assertion should be considered, I think the District Court correctly noted that there is nothing in the record [**784]  that indicates licensees have treated purchasers unfairly.  251 F. Supp. 2d, at 812 (Leon, J.).  In addition, this interest seems wholly unconnected to the central purpose of BCRA, and it is not at all similar to the governmental interests in Buckley that we found to be "sufficiently important to outweigh the possibility of infringement,"  424 U.S., at 66, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612. 
As to the disclosure requirements involving "any political matter of  [***686]  national importance" under the new Communications Act § 315(e)(1)(B), the Government suggests that the disclosure enables viewers to evaluate the message transmitted. 6  First, insofar as BCRA § 504 requires reporting of  [*362]  "request[s for] broadcast time" as well as actual broadcasts, it is not supported by this goal.  Requests that do not mature into actual purchases will have no viewers, but the information may allow competitors or adversaries to obtain information regarding organizational or political [****292]  strategies of purchasers. Second, even as to broadcasts themselves, in this noncandidate-related context, this goal is a far cry from the Government interests endorsed in Buckley, which were limited to evaluating and preventing corruption of federal candidates. Ibid.; see also McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U.S. 334, 354, 131 L. Ed. 2d 426, 115 S. Ct. 1511 (1995). 
As to disclosure requirements with respect to candidates under the new Communications Act § 315(e)(1)(A), BCRA § 504 significantly overlaps with § 201, which is today also upheld by this Court, ante, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 580-584 (joint opinion of Stevens and O'Connor, JJ.), and requires purchasers of "electioneering communications" to disclose a wide array of information, including [****293]  the amount of each disbursement and the elections to which electioneering communications pertain.  While I recognize that there is this overlap, § 504 imposes a different burden on the purchaser's First Amendment rights: as noted above, § 201 is limited to purchasers' disclosure of disbursements for electioneering communications, whereas § 504 requires broadcast licensees' disclosure of requests for broadcast time by purchasers. Not only are the purchasers' requests, which may never result in an actual advertisement, subject to the disclosure requirements, but § 504 will undoubtedly result in increased costs of communication because the licensees will shift the costs of the onerous disclosure and recordkeeping requirements to purchasers. The Government fails to offer a reason for the separate burden and apparent overlap. 
The Government cannot justify, and for that matter, has not attempted to justify, its requirement that "request[s for] broadcast" time be publicized.  On the record before this Court, I cannot even speculate as to a governmental interest  [*363]  that would allow me to conclude that the disclosure of "requests" should be upheld.  Such disclosure risks,  [****294]  inter alia, allowing candidates and political groups the opportunity to ferret out a purchaser's political strategy and, ultimately, unduly burdens the First Amendment freedoms of purchasers. 
Absent some showing of a Government interest served by § 504 and in light of the breadth of disclosure of "requests," I must conclude that § 504 fails to satisfy First Amendment scrutiny. 
 [***687]  Justice Stevens, dissenting with [**785]  respect to § 305. * 
The Chief Justice, writing for the Court, concludes that the McConnell plaintiffs lack standing to challenge § 305 of BCRA because Senator McConnell cannot be affected by the provision until "45 days before the Republican primary election in 2008."  Ante, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 606.  I am not persuaded that Article III's case-or-controversy requirement imposes such a strict temporal limit on our jurisdiction.  By asserting that he has run attack ads in the past, that he plans to run such ads in his next campaign, and that [****295]  § 305 will adversely affect his campaign strategy, Senator McConnell has identified a "concrete," "'distinct,'" and "'actual'" injury, Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155, 109 L. Ed. 2d 135, 110 S. Ct. 1717 (1990).  That the injury is distant in time does not make it illusory. 
The second prong of the standing inquiry--whether the alleged injury is fairly traceable to the defendants' challenged action and not the result of a third party's independent choices + --poses a closer question.  Section 305 does not require broadcast stations to charge a candidate higher rates for unsigned ads that mention the candidate's opponent.  Rather, the provision simply permits stations to charge their normal rates for such ads.  Some stations may take advantage  [*364]  of this regulatory gap and adopt pricing schemes that discriminate between the kind of ads that Senator McConnell has run in the past and those that strictly comply with § 305.  It is also possible, however, that instead of incurring the transaction costs of policing candidates' compliance with § 305, stations will continue to charge the same rates for attack ads as for all other campaign ads.  In the absence of any record evidence that stations will [****296]  uniformly choose to charge Senator McConnell higher rates for the attack ads he proposes to run in 2008, it is at least arguable that his alleged injury is not traceable to BCRA § 305
Nevertheless, I would entertain plaintiffs' challenge to § 305 on the merits and uphold the section.  Like BCRA §§ 201, 212, and 311, § 305 serves an important--and constitutionally sufficient--informational purpose.  Moreover, § 305's disclosure requirements largely overlap those of § 311, and plaintiffs identify no reason why any candidate already in compliance with § 311 will be harmed by the marginal additional burden of complying with § 305.  Indeed, I am convinced that "the important governmental interest of 'shed[ding] the light of publicity' on campaign financing," invoked above in connection with § 311, ante, at ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 603 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.), would suffice to support a legislative provision expressly requiring all sponsors of attack [****297]  ads to identify themselves in their ads.  That § 305 seeks to achieve the same purpose indirectly, by withdrawing a statutory benefit, does not render the provision any less sound. 
Finally, I do not regard § 305 as a constitutionally suspect "viewpoint-based regulation." Brief for Appellants/Cross-Appellees Senator Mitch McConnell et al. in No. 02-1674 et al., p 67.  Like BCRA's other  [***688]  disclosure requirements, § 305 evenhandedly regulates speech based on its electioneering content.  Although the section reaches only ads that mention opposing candidates, it applies equally to all such ads.  Disagreement with one's opponent obviously expresses a [*365]  "viewpoint,"  [**786]  but § 305 treats that expression exactly like the opponent's response. 
In sum, I would uphold § 305.

 [***614contd]  [**720contd]  [*247contd]    Justice Scalia, concurring with respect to BCRA Titles III and IV, dissenting with respect to BCRA Titles I and V,  [*248]  and concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part with respect to BCRA Title II.
With respect to Titles I, II, and V: I join in full the dissent of the Chief Justice; I join the opinion of Justice Kennedy, except to the extent it upholds new § 323(e) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA)  [****298]  and § 202 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) in part; and because I continue to believe that Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612 (1976) (per curiam), was wrongly decided, I also join Parts I, II-A, and II-B of the opinion of Justice Thomas.  With respect to Titles III and IV, I join The Chief Justice's opinion for the Court.  Because these cases are of such extraordinary importance, I cannot avoid adding to the many writings a few words of my own. 
This is a sad day for the freedom of speech.  Who could have imagined that the same Court which, within the past four years, has sternly disapproved of restrictions upon such inconsequential forms of expression as virtual child pornography, Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234, 152 L. Ed. 2d 403, 122 S. Ct. 1389 (2002), tobacco advertising, Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U.S. 525, 150 L. Ed. 2d 532, 121 S. Ct. 2404 (2001), dissemination of illegally intercepted communications, Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514, 149 L. Ed. 2d 787, 121 S. Ct. 1753 (2001), and sexually explicit cable programming, United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 146 L. Ed. 2d 865, 120 S. Ct. 1878 (2000), would smile with favor upon a law that cuts to [****299]  the heart of what the First Amendment is meant to protect: the right to criticize the government.  For that is what the most offensive provisions of this legislation are all about.  We are governed by Congress, and this legislation prohibits the criticism of Members of Congress by those entities most capable of giving such criticism loud voice: national political parties and corporations, both of the commercial and  [***615]  the not-for-profit sort.  It forbids pre-election criticism of incumbents by corporations, even not-for-profit corporations, by use of their general funds; and forbids national-party use of "soft" money to fund "issue ads" that incumbents find so offensive. 
 [*249]  To be sure, the legislation is evenhanded: It similarly prohibits criticism of the candidates who oppose Members of Congress in their reelection bids.  But as everyone knows, this is an area in which evenhandedness is not fairness.  If all electioneering were evenhandedly prohibited, incumbents would have an enormous [**721]  advantage.  Likewise, if incumbents and challengers are limited to the same quantity of electioneering, incumbents are favored.  In other words, any restriction upon a type of campaign speech that is equally [****300]  available to challengers and incumbents tends to favor incumbents. 
Beyond that, however, the present legislation targets for prohibition certain categories of campaign speech that are particularly harmful to incumbents. Is it accidental, do you think, that incumbents raise about three times as much "hard money"--the sort of funding generally not restricted by this legislation--as do their challengers?  See FEC, 1999-2000 Financial Activity of All Senate and House Campaigns (Jan. 1, 1999-Dec. 31, 2000) (last modified on May 15, 2001), http://www.fec.gov/press/051501congfinact/tables/allcong2000.xls (all Internet materials as visited Dec. 4, 2003, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).  Or that lobbyists (who seek the favor of incumbents) give 92 percent of their money in "hard" contributions?  See U.S. Public Interest Research Group, The Lobbyist's Last Laugh: How K Street Lobbyists Would Benefit from the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Bill 3 (July 5, 2001), http://www.pirg.org/democracy/democracy.asp?id2=5068.  Is it an oversight, do you suppose, that the so-called "millionaire provisions" raise the contribution limit for a candidate running against an individual [****301]  who devotes to the campaign (as challengers often do) great personal wealth, but do not raise the limit for a candidate running against an individual who devotes to the campaign (as incumbents often do) a massive election "war chest"?  See BCRA §§ 304, 316, and 319.  And is it mere happenstance, do you estimate, that national-party funding,  [*250]  which is severely limited by the Act, is more likely to assist cash-strapped challengers than flush-with-hard-money incumbents? See A. Gierzynski & D. Breaux, The Financing Role of Parties, in Campaign Finance in State Legislative Elections 195-200 (J. Thompson & S. Moncrief eds. 1998).  Was it unintended, by any chance, that incumbents are free personally to receive some soft money and even to solicit it for other organizations, while national parties are not?  See new FECA §§ 323(a) and (e). 
I wish to address three fallacious propositions that might be thought to justify some or all of the provisions of this legislation--only the last of which is explicitly embraced by the principal opinion for the Court, but all of which underlie, I think, its approach to these cases. 
(a) Money is Not Speech 
It was said by congressional proponents of this legislation,  [****302]  see 143 Cong. Rec. 20746 (1997) (remarks of Sen. Boxer), 145 Cong. Rec. S12612  [***616]  (Oct. 14, 1999) (remarks of Sen. Cleland), 147 Cong. Rec. S2436 (Mar. 19, 2001) (remarks of Sen. Dodd), with support from the law reviews, see, e.g., Wright, Politics and the Constitution: Is Money Speech? 85 Yale L. J. 1001 (1976), that since this legislation regulates nothing but the expenditure of money for speech, as opposed to speech itself, the burden it imposes is not subject to full First Amendment scrutiny; the government may regulate the raising and spending of campaign funds just as it regulates other forms of conduct, such as burning draft cards, see United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 20 L. Ed. 2d 672, 88 S. Ct. 1673 (1968), or camping out on the National Mall, see Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 82 L. Ed. 2d 221, 104 S. Ct. 3065 (1984).  That proposition has been endorsed by one of the two authors of today's principal opinion: "The right to use one's own money to hire gladiators, [and] to fund 'speech by proxy,' . . .  [**722]  [are] property rights . . . not entitled to the same protection as the right to say what one pleases."  Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 399,  [*251]  145 L. Ed. 2d 886, 120 S. Ct. 897 (2000) [****303]  (Stevens, J., concurring).  Until today, however, that view has been categorically rejected by our jurisprudence.  As we said in  Buckley, 424 U.S., at 16, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612, "this Court has never suggested that the dependence of a communication on the expenditure of money operates itself to introduce a nonspeech element or to reduce the exacting scrutiny required by the First Amendment." 
Our traditional view was correct, and today's cavalier attitude toward regulating the financing of speech (the "exacting scrutiny" test of Buckley, see ibid., is not uttered in any majority opinion, and is not observed in the ones from which I dissent) frustrates the fundamental purpose of the First Amendment. In any economy operated on even the most rudimentary principles of division of labor, effective public communication requires the speaker to make use of the services of others.  An author may write a novel, but he will seldom publish and distribute it himself.  A freelance reporter may write a story, but he will rarely edit, print, and deliver it to subscribers.  To a government bent on suppressing speech, this mode of organization presents opportunities: Control any cog in the machine, and [****304]  you can halt the whole apparatus.  License printers, and it matters little whether authors are still free to write.  Restrict the sale of books, and it matters little who prints them.  Predictably, repressive regimes have exploited these principles by attacking all levels of the production and dissemination of ideas.  See, e.g., Printing Act of 1662, 14 Car. II, c. 33, §§ 1, 4, 7 (punishing printers, importers, and booksellers); Printing Act of 1649, 2 Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum 245, 246, 250 (punishing authors, printers, booksellers, importers, and buyers).  In response to this threat, we have interpreted the First Amendment broadly.  See, e.g., Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 65, n. 6, 9 L. Ed. 2d 584, 83 S. Ct. 631 (1963) ("The constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press embraces the circulation of books as well as their publication . . ."). 
 [*252]  Division of labor requires a means of mediating exchange, and in a commercial society, that means is supplied by money.  The publisher pays the author for the right to sell his  [***617]  book; it pays its staff who print and assemble the book; it demands payments from booksellers who bring the book to market.  This, too, presents [****305]  opportunities for repression: Instead of regulating the various parties to the enterprise individually, the government can suppress their ability to coordinate by regulating their use of money.  What good is the right to print books without a right to buy works from authors?  Or the right to publish newspapers without the right to pay deliverymen?  The right to speak would be largely ineffective if it did not include the right to engage in financial transactions that are the incidents of its exercise. 
This is not to say that any regulation of money is a regulation of speech.  The government may apply general commercial regulations to those who use money for speech if it applies them evenhandedly to those who use money for other purposes.  But where the government singles out money used to fund speech as its legislative object, it is acting against speech as such, no less than if it had targeted the paper on which a book was printed or the trucks that deliver it to the bookstore. 
History and jurisprudence bear this out.  The best early examples derive from the British efforts to tax the press after the lapse of licensing statutes by which the [**723]  press was first regulated.  The Stamp Act [****306]  of 1712 imposed levies on all newspapers, including an additional tax for each advertisement. 10 Anne, c. 18, § 113.  It was a response to unfavorable war coverage, "obvious[ly] . . . designed to check the publication of those newspapers and pamphlets which depended for their sale on their cheapness and sensationalism." F. Siebert, Freedom of the Press in England, 1476-1776, pp 309-310 (1952).  It succeeded in killing off approximately half the newspapers in England in its first year.  Id., at 312.  In 1765, Parliament applied a similar Act to the Colonies.   [*253]  5 Geo. III, c. 12, § 1.  The colonial Act likewise placed exactions on sales and advertising revenue, the latter at 2s. per advertisement, which was "by any standard . . . excessive, since the publisher himself received only from 3 to 5s. and still less for repeated insertions." A. Schlesinger, Prelude to Independence: The Newspaper War on Britain, 1764-1776, p 68 (1958).  The founding generation saw these taxes as grievous incursions on the freedom of the press.  See, e.g., 1 D. Ramsay, History of the American Revolution 61-62 (L. Cohen ed. 1990); J. Adams, A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law (1765), reprinted in 3 Life [****307]  and Works of John Adams 445, 464 (C. Adams ed. 1851).  See generally Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U.S. 233, 245-249, 80 L. Ed. 660, 56 S. Ct. 444 (1936); Schlesinger, supra, at 67-84. 
We have kept faith with the Founders' tradition by prohibiting the selective taxation of the press.  Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575, 75 L. Ed. 2d 295, 103 S. Ct. 1365 (1983) (ink and paper tax); Grosjean, supra (advertisement tax).  And we have done so whether the tax was the product of illicit motive or not.  See Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co., supra, at 592, 75 L. Ed. 2d 295, 103 S. Ct. 1365.  These press-taxation cases belie the claim that regulation of money used to fund speech is not regulation of speech itself.  A tax on a newspaper's advertising revenue does not prohibit anyone  [***618]  from saying anything; it merely appropriates part of the revenue that a speaker would otherwise obtain.  That is even a step short of totally prohibiting advertising revenue--which would be analogous to the total prohibition of certain campaign-speech contributions in the present cases.  Yet it is unquestionably a violation of the First Amendment.
Many other cases exemplify the same principle that an attack [****308]  upon the funding of speech is an attack upon speech itself.  In  Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U.S. 620, 63 L. Ed. 2d 73, 100 S. Ct. 826 (1980), we struck down an ordinance limiting the amount charities could pay their solicitors.  In   Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims  [*254]  Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 116 L. Ed. 2d 476, 112 S. Ct. 501 (1991), we held unconstitutional a state statute that appropriated the proceeds of criminals' biographies for payment to the victims.  And in Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700, 115 S. Ct. 2510 (1995), we held unconstitutional a university's discrimination in the disbursement of funds to speakers on the basis of viewpoint.  Most notable, perhaps, is our famous opinion in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686, 84 S. Ct. 710 (1964), holding that paid advertisements in a newspaper were entitled to full First Amendment protection: 
"Any other conclusion would discourage newspapers from carrying 'editorial advertisements' of this type, and so might shut off an important outlet for the promulgation of information and ideas by persons who do not themselves have access to publishing facilities--who [****309]  wish to exercise their freedom of speech even though they are not members of the [**724]  press.  The effect would be to shackle the First Amendment in its attempt to secure 'the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources.'"  Id., at 266, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686, 84 S. Ct. 710 (citations omitted).
This passage was relied on in Buckley for the point that restrictions on the expenditure of money for speech are equivalent to restrictions on speech itself.  424 U.S., at 16-17, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612.  That reliance was appropriate.  If denying protection to paid-for speech would "shackle the First Amendment," so also does forbidding or limiting the right to pay for speech. 
It should be obvious, then, that a law limiting the amount a person can spend to broadcast his political views is a direct restriction on speech.  That is no different from a law limiting the amount a newspaper can pay its editorial staff or the amount a charity can pay its leafletters.  It is equally clear that a limit on the amount a candidate can raise from any one individual for the purpose of speaking is also a direct limitation on speech.  That is no different from a law limiting  [*255]  the amount a publisher can [****310]  accept from any one shareholder or lender, or the amount a newspaper can charge any one advertiser or customer. 
(b) Pooling Money is Not Speech 
Another proposition which could explain at least some of the results of today's opinion is that the First Amendment right to spend money for speech does not include the right to combine with others in spending money for speech.  Such a proposition fits uncomfortably with the concluding  [***619]  words of our Declaration of Independence: "And for the support of this Declaration, . . . we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor." (Emphasis added.) The freedom to associate with others for the dissemination of ideas--not just by singing or speaking in unison, but by pooling financial resources for expressive purposes--is part of the freedom of speech. 
"Our form of government is built on the premise that every citizen shall have the right to engage in political expression and association.  This right was enshrined in the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights.  Exercise of these basic freedoms in America has traditionally been through the media of political associations.  Any interference with the freedom of [****311]  a party is simultaneously an interference with the freedom of its adherents."  NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 431, [9 L. Ed. 2d 405, 83 S. Ct. 328] (1963) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
"The First Amendment protects political association as well as political expression.  The constitutional right of association explicated in NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 460, [2 L. Ed. 2d 1488, 78 S. Ct. 1163] (1958), stemmed from the Court's recognition that '[e]ffective advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association.' Subsequent decisions have made clear that the First and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee '"freedom to associate with others  [*256]  for the common advancement of political beliefs and ideas,"'. . . ."  Buckley, supra, at 15, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612.
We have said that "implicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment" is "a corresponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational, religious, and cultural ends."  Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 622, 82 L. Ed. 2d 462, 104 S. Ct. 3244 (1984).  That "right to associate . . . in pursuit" includes the [****312]  right to pool financial resources. 
 [**725]  If it were otherwise, Congress would be empowered to enact legislation requiring newspapers to be sole proprietorships, banning their use of partnership or corporate form.  That sort of restriction would be an obvious violation of the First Amendment, and it is incomprehensible why the conclusion should change when what is at issue is the pooling of funds for the most important (and most perennially threatened) category of speech: electoral speech.  The principle that such financial association does not enjoy full First Amendment protection threatens the existence of all political parties. 
(c) Speech by Corporations Can Be Abridged 
The last proposition that might explain at least some of today's casual abridgment of free-speech rights is this: that the particular form of association known as a corporation does not enjoy full First Amendment protection.  Of course the text of the First Amendment does not limit its application in this fashion, even though "[b]y the end of the eighteenth century the corporation was a familiar figure in American economic life." C. Cooke, Corporation, Trust and Company 92 (1951).  Nor is there  [***620]  any basis in reason why  [****313]  First Amendment rights should not attach to corporate associations--and we have said so.  In First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 55 L. Ed. 2d 707, 98 S. Ct. 1407 (1978), we held unconstitutional a state prohibition of corporate speech designed to influence the vote on referendum proposals.  We said: 
 [*257]  "[T]here is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of [the First] Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs.  If the speakers here were not corporations, no one would suggest that the State could silence their proposed speech.  It is the type of speech indispensable to decisionmaking in a democracy, and this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than an individual.  The inherent worth of the speech in terms of its capacity for informing the public does not depend upon the identity of its source, whether corporation, association, union, or individual."  Id., at 776-777, 55 L. Ed. 2d 707, 98 S. Ct. 1407 (internal quotation marks, footnotes, and citations omitted).
In NAACP v. Button, supra, at 428-429, 431, 9 L. Ed. 2d 405, 83 S. Ct. 328, we held that the NAACP could assert First Amendment rights "on its own behalf, . . . though a corporation,"  [****314]  and that the activities of the corporation were "modes of expression and association protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments." In  Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n of Cal., 475 U.S. 1, 8, 89 L. Ed. 2d 1, 106 S. Ct. 903 (1986), we held unconstitutional a state effort to compel corporate speech.  "The identity of the speaker," we said, "is not decisive in determining whether speech is protected.  Corporations and other associations, like individuals, contribute to the 'discussion, debate, and the dissemination of information and ideas' that the First Amendment seeks to foster." And in Buckley, 424 U.S. 1, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612, we held unconstitutional FECA's limitation upon independent corporate expenditures. 
The Court changed course in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652, 108 L. Ed. 2d 652, 110 S. Ct. 1391 (1990), upholding a state prohibition of an independent corporate expenditure in support of a candidate for state office.  I dissented in that case, see id., at 679, 108 L. Ed. 2d 652, 110 S. Ct. 1391, and remain of the view that it was error.  In the modern world, giving the government power to exclude corporations from the political debate enables it effectively to muffle the voices that best [****315]   [**726]  represent the most significant  [*258]  segments of the economy and the most passionately held social and political views.  People who associate--who pool their financial resources--for purposes of economic enterprise overwhelmingly do so in the corporate form; and with increasing frequency, incorporation is chosen by those who associate to defend and promote particular ideas--such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Rifle Association, parties to these cases.  Imagine, then, a government that wished to suppress nuclear power--or oil and gas exploration, or automobile manufacturing, or gun ownership, or civil liberties--and that had the power to prohibit corporate advertising against its proposals.  To be sure, the individuals involved in, or benefited by, those industries, or interested in those  [***621]  causes, could (given enough time) form political action committees or other associations to make their case.  But the organizational form in which those enterprises already exist, and in which they can most quickly and most effectively get their message across, is the corporate form.  The First Amendment does not in my view permit the restriction of that political speech.  [****316]  And the same holds true for corporate electoral speech: A candidate should not be insulated from the most effective speech that the major participants in the economy and major incorporated interest groups can generate. 
But what about the danger to the political system posed by "amassed wealth"?  The most direct threat from that source comes in the form of undisclosed favors and payoffs to elected officials--which have already been criminalized, and will be rendered no more discoverable by the legislation at issue here.  The use of corporate wealth (like individual wealth) to speak to the electorate is unlikely to "distort" elections--especially if disclosure requirements tell the people where the speech is coming from.  The premise of the First Amendment is that the American people are neither sheep nor fools, and hence fully capable of considering both the substance of the speech presented to them and its proximate  [*259]  and ultimate source.  If that premise is wrong, our democracy has a much greater problem to overcome than merely the influence of amassed wealth.  Given the premises of democracy, there is no such thing as too much speech. 
But, it is argued, quite apart from [****317]  its effect upon the electorate, corporate speech in the form of contributions to the candidate's campaign, or even in the form of independent expenditures supporting the candidate, engenders an obligation which is later paid in the form of greater access to the officeholder, or indeed in the form of votes on particular bills.  Any quid-pro-quo agreement for votes would of course violate criminal law, see 18 USC § 201 [18 USCS § 201], and actual payoff votes have not even been claimed by those favoring the restrictions on corporate speech.  It cannot be denied, however, that corporate (like noncorporate) allies will have greater access to the officeholder, and that he will tend to favor the same causes as those who support him (which is usually why they supported him).  That is the nature of politics--if not indeed human nature--and how this can properly be considered "corruption" (or "the appearance of corruption") with regard to corporate allies and not with regard to other allies is beyond me.  If the Bill of Rights had intended an exception to the freedom of speech in order to combat this malign proclivity of the officeholder to agree with those who agree with [****318]  him, and to speak more with his supporters than his opponents, it would surely have said so.  It did not do so, I think, because the juice is not worth the squeeze.  Evil corporate (and private affluent) influences are well enough checked [**727]  (so long as adequate campaign-expenditure disclosure rules exist) by the politician's fear of being portrayed as "in the pocket" of so-called moneyed interests.  The incremental benefit obtained by muzzling corporate speech is more than offset by loss of the information and persuasion that corporate speech can contain.  That, at least, is the assumption of a constitutional guarantee which prescribes that Congress  [***622]  shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. 
 [*260]  But let us not be deceived.  While the Government's briefs and arguments before this Court focused on the horrible "appearance of corruption," the most passionate floor statements during the debates on this legislation pertained to so-called attack ads, which the Constitution surely protects, but which Members of Congress analogized to "crack cocaine," 144 Cong. Rec. S868 (Feb. 24, 1998) (remarks of Sen. Daschle), "drive-by shooting[s]," id., at S879 (remarks of Sen. Durbin), and "air pollution,  [****319]  " 143 Cong. Rec. 20505 (1997) (remarks of Sen. Dorgan).  There is good reason to believe that the ending of negative campaign ads was the principal attraction of the legislation.  A Senate sponsor said, "I hope that we will not allow our attention to be distracted from the real issues at hand--how to raise the tenor of the debate in our elections and give people real choices.  No one benefits from negative ads.  They don't aid our Nation's political dialog." Id., at 20521-20522 (remarks of Sen. McCain).  He assured the body that "[y]ou cut off the soft money, you are going to see a lot less of that [attack ads].  Prohibit unions and corporations, and you will see a lot less of that.  If you demand full disclosure for those who pay for those ads, you are going to see a lot less of that . . . ." 147 Cong. Rec. S3116 (Mar. 29, 2001) (remarks of Sen. McCain).  See also, e.g., 148 Cong. Rec. S2117 (Mar. 20, 2002) (remarks of Sen. Cantwell) ("This bill is about slowing the ad war . . . .  It is about slowing political advertising and making sure the flow of negative ads by outside interest groups does not continue to permeate the airwaves"); 143 Cong. Rec. 20746 (1997) (remarks of Sen. Boxer)  [****320]  ("These so-called issues ads are not regulated at all and mention candidates by name.  They directly attack candidates without any accountability.  It is brutal. . . . We have an opportunity in the McCain-Feingold bill to stop that . . ."); 145 Cong. Rec. S12606-S12607 (Oct. 14, 1999) (remarks of Sen. Wellstone) ("I think these issue advocacy ads are a nightmare.  I think all of us should hate them. . . . [By passing the legislation], [w]e could get some of this poison politics off television"). 
 [*261]  Another theme prominent in the legislative debates was the notion that there is too much money spent on elections. The first principle of "reform" was that "there should be less money in politics." 147 Cong. Rec. S3236 (Apr. 2, 2001) (remarks of Sen. Murray).  "The enormous amounts of special interest money that flood our political system have become a cancer in our democracy." 148 Cong. Rec. S2151 (Mar. 20, 2002) (remarks of Sen. Kennedy).  "[L]arge sums of money drown out the voice of the average voter." Id., at H373 (Feb. 13, 2002) (remarks of Rep. Langevin).  The system of campaign finance is "drowning in money." Id., at H404 (remarks of Rep. Menendez).  And most expansively: 
"Despite [****321]  the ever-increasing sums spent on campaigns, we have not seen an improvement in campaign discourse, issue discussion or voter education.  More money does not mean more ideas, more substance or more depth.  Instead, it means more of what voters complain about most.  More 30-second spots, more negativity and an increasingly longer campaign period." Id. at  [***623]   [**728]  S2150 (Mar. 20, 2002) (remarks of Sen. Kerry).
Perhaps voters do detest these 30-second spots--though I suspect they detest even more hour-long campaign-debate interruptions of their favorite entertainment programming.  Evidently, however, these ads do persuade voters, or else they would not be so routinely used by sophisticated politicians of all parties.  The point, in any event, is that it is not the proper role of those who govern us to judge which campaign speech has "substance" and "depth" (do you think it might be that which is least damaging to incumbents?) and to abridge the rest. 
And what exactly are these outrageous sums frittered away in determining who will govern us?  A report prepared for Congress concluded that the total amount, in hard and soft money, spent on the 2000 federal elections was between  [*262]   [****322]  $2.4 and $2.5 billion.  J. Cantor, CRS Report for Congress, Campaign Finance in the 2000 Federal Elections: Overview and Estimates of the Flow of Money (2001).  All campaign spending in the United States, including state elections, ballot initiatives, and judicial elections, has been estimated at $3.9 billion for 2000, Nelson, Spending in the 2000 Elections, in Financing the 2000 Election 24, Tbl. 2-1 (D. Magleby ed. 2002), which was a year that "shattered spending and contribution records," id., at 22.  Even taking this last, larger figure as the benchmark, it means that Americans spent about half as much electing all their Nation's officials, state and federal, as they spent on movie tickets ($7.8 billion); about a fifth as much as they spent on cosmetics and perfume ($18.8 billion); and about a sixth as much as they spent on pork (the nongovernmental sort) ($22.8 billion).  See U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Tbl. 2.6U (Col. AS; Rows 356, 214, and 139), http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn/206u.csv.  If our democracy is drowning from this much spending, it cannot swim. 
* * * 
Which brings me back to where I began: This litigation is about preventing criticism [****323]  of the government.  I cannot say for certain that many, or some, or even any, of the Members of Congress who voted for this legislation did so not to produce "fairer" campaigns, but to mute criticism of their records and facilitate reelection.  Indeed, I will stipulate that all those who voted for the Act believed they were acting for the good of the country.  There remains the problem of the Charlie Wilson Phenomenon, named after Charles Wilson, former president of General Motors, who is supposed to have said during the Senate hearing on his nomination as Secretary of Defense that "what's good for General Motors  [*263]  is good for the country." *  Those in power, even giving them the benefit of the greatest good will, are inclined to believe that what is good for them is good for the country.  Whether in prescient recognition of the Charlie Wilson Phenomenon, or out of fear of good old-fashioned, malicious, self-interested manipulation, "[t]he fundamental approach of the First Amendment . . . was to assume the  [***624]  worst, and to rule the regulation of political speech 'for fairness' sake' simply out of bounds."  Austin, 494 U.S., at 693, 108 L. Ed. 2d 652, 110 S. Ct. 1391 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Having abandoned that [****324]  approach to a limited extent in Buckley, we abandon it much further today. 
We will unquestionably be called upon to abandon it further still in the future.  The [**729]  most frightening passage in the lengthy floor debates on this legislation is the following assurance given by one of the cosponsoring Senators to his colleagues: 
"This is a modest step, it is a first step, it is an essential step, but it does not even begin to address, in some ways, the fundamental problems that exist with the hard money aspect of the system." 148 Cong. Rec. S2101 (Mar. 20, 2002) (statement of Sen. Feingold).
The system indeed.  The first instinct of power is the retention of power, and, under a Constitution that [****325]  requires periodic elections, that is best achieved by the suppression of election-time speech.  We have witnessed merely the second scene of Act I of what promises to be a lengthy tragedy.  In scene 3 the Court, having abandoned most of the First Amendment weaponry that Buckley left intact, will be even less equipped to resist the incumbents' writing of the rules  [*264]  of political debate.  The federal election campaign laws, which are already (as today's opinions show) so voluminous, so detailed, so complex, that no ordinary citizen dare run for office, or even contribute a significant sum, without hiring an expert adviser in the field, can be expected to grow more voluminous, more detailed, and more complex in the years to come--and always, always, with the objective of reducing the excessive amount of speech. 
Justice Thomas, concurring with respect to BCRA Titles III and IV, except for BCRA §§ 311 and 318, concurring in the result with respect to BCRA § 318, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part with respect to BCRA Title II, and dissenting with respect to BCRA Titles I, V, and § 311.* 
 [****326]  The First Amendment provides that "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech." Nevertheless, the Court today upholds what can only be described as the most significant abridgment of the freedoms of speech and association since the Civil War.  With breathtaking scope, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), directly targets and constricts core political speech, the "primary object of First Amendment protection."  Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 410-411, 145 L. Ed. 2d 886, 120 S. Ct. 897 (2000) (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Because "the First Amendment 'has its fullest and most urgent application' to speech uttered during a campaign for political office," Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 223, 103 L. Ed. 2d 271, 109 S. Ct. 1013 (1989) (quoting Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U.S. 265, 272, 28 L. Ed. 2d 35, 91 S. Ct. 621 (1971)), our duty is to approach these restrictions "with the utmost skepticism" and subject them to the "strictest scrutiny."  Shrink Missouri, supra, at 412, 145 L. Ed. 2d 886, 120 S. Ct. 897 (Thomas, J., dissenting). 
 [***625]   [*265]  In response to this assault on the free exchange of ideas and with only the slightest consideration of the appropriate standard of review [****327]  or of the Court's traditional role of protecting First Amendment freedoms, the Court has placed its imprimatur on these unprecedented restrictions.  The very "purpose of the First Amendment [is] to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail."  Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 390, 23 L. Ed. 2d 371, 89 S. Ct. 1794 (1969).  Yet today the fundamental principle that "the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market,"  [**730]   Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 630, 63 L. Ed. 1173, 40 S. Ct. 17 (1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting), is cast aside in the purported service of preventing "corruption," or the mere "appearance of corruption."  Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 26, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612 (1976) (per curiam). Apparently, the marketplace of ideas is to be fully open only to defamers,  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686, 84 S. Ct. 710 (1964); nude dancers,  Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560, 115 L. Ed. 2d 504, 111 S. Ct. 2456 (1991) (plurality opinion); pornographers, Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234, 152 L. Ed. 2d 403, 122 S. Ct. 1389 (2002); flag burners, United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310, 110 L. Ed. 2d 287, 110 S. Ct. 2404 (1990); [****328]  and cross burners,  Virginia v. Black, 538 U.S. 343, 155 L. Ed. 2d 535, 123 S. Ct. 1536 (2003). 
Because I cannot agree with the treatment given by Justice Stevens' and Justice O'Connor's opinion (hereinafter joint opinion) to speech that is "indispensable to the effective and intelligent use of the processes of popular government to shape the destiny of modern industrial society," Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88, 103, 84 L. Ed. 1093, 60 S. Ct. 736 (1940), I respectfully dissent.  I also dissent from Justice Breyer's opinion upholding BCRA § 504.  I join the Chief Justice's opinion in regards to BCRA §§ 304, 305, 307, 316, 319, and 403(b); concur in the result as to § 318; and dissent from the opinion as to § 311.  I also fully agree with Justice Kennedy's discussion of § 213 and join that portion of his opinion.  Post, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 659-660. 
 [*266]  I 
A 
"[C]ampaign finance laws are subject to strict scrutiny," FEC v. Beaumont, 539 U.S. 146, ___, 156 L. Ed. 2d 179, 123 S. Ct. 2200 (2003) (slip op., at 1) (Thomas, J., dissenting), and thus Title I must satisfy that demanding standard even if it were (incorrectly) conceived of as nothing more than a contribution limitation.  The defendants do not even attempt to defend Title I under this standard,  [****329]  and for good reason: The various restrictions imposed by Title I are much less narrowly tailored to target only corrupting or problematic donations than even the contribution limits in Shrink Missouri. See 528 U.S., at 427-430, 145 L. Ed. 2d 886, 120 S. Ct. 897 (Thomas, J., dissenting); see also Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 518 U.S. 604, 641-644, 135 L. Ed. 2d 795, 116 S. Ct. 2309 (1996) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (Colorado I). And, as I have previously noted, it is unclear why "[b]ribery laws [that] bar precisely the quid pro quo arrangements that  [***626]  are targeted here" and "disclosure laws" are not "less restrictive means of addressing [the Government's] interest in curtailing corruption."  Shrink Missouri, supra, at 428, 145 L. Ed. 2d 886, 120 S. Ct. 897. 
The joint opinion not only continues the errors of Buckley v Valeo, by applying a low level of scrutiny to contribution ceilings, but also builds upon these errors by expanding the anticircumvention rationale beyond reason.  Admittedly, exploitation of an anticircumvention concept has a long pedigree, going back at least to Buckley itself.  Buckley upheld a $1,000 contribution ceiling as a way to combat both the "actuality and [****330]  appearance of corruption."  424 U.S., at 26, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612.  The challengers in Buckley contended both that bribery laws represented "a less restrictive means of dealing with 'proven and suspected quid pro quo arrangements,'" id., 424 U.S. at 27, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612, and that the $1,000 contribution ceiling was overbroad as "most large contributors do not seek improper influence over a candidate's position or an officeholder's action," id., at 29, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612.  [**731]  The  [*267]  Court rejected the first argument on the grounds that "laws making criminal the giving and taking of bribes deal with only the most blatant and specific attempts of those with money to influence governmental action," id., at 27-28, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612, and rejected the second on the grounds that "it [is] difficult to isolate suspect contributions," id., at 30, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612. 1  [****331]  But a broadly drawn bribery law 2  would cover even subtle and general attempts to influence government officials corruptly, eliminating the Court's first concern.  And, an effective bribery law would deter actual quid pro quos and would, in all likelihood, eliminate any appearance of corruption in the system. 
Hence, at root, the Buckley Court was concerned that bribery laws could not be effectively enforced to prevent quid pro quos between donors and officeholders, and the only rational reading of Buckley is that it approved the $1,000 contribution ceiling on this ground.  The Court then, however, having at least in part concluded that individual contribution ceilings were necessary to prevent easy evasion of bribery laws, proceeded to uphold a separate contribution limitation, using, as the only justification, the "prevent[ion] [of] evasion of the $1,000 contribution limitation."  Id., at 38, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612.  The need to prevent circumvention of a limitation that was itself an anticircumvention measure led to the upholding of  [*268]  another significant restriction on individuals' freedom of speech. 
The joint opinion now repeats this [****332]   [***627]  process.  New Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) § 323(a), 2 USC § 441i(a) (Supp. II) [2 USCS § 441i(a)], is intended to prevent easy circumvention of the (now) $2,000 contribution ceiling.  The joint opinion even recognizes this, relying heavily on evidence that, for instance, "candidates and donors alike have in fact exploited the soft-money loophole, the former to increase their prospects of election and the latter to create debt on the part of officeholders, with the national parties serving as willing intermediaries."  Ante, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 550.  The joint opinion upholds § 323(a), in part, on the grounds that it had become too easy to circumvent the $2,000 cap by using the national parties as go-betweens. 
And the remaining provisions of new FECA § 323 are upheld mostly as measures preventing circumvention of other contribution limits, including § 323(a), ante, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 561-562 (§ 323(b)); ante, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 567-570 (§ 323(d)); ante, at ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 572-573 (§ 323(e)); ante, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 574 (§ 323(f)), which, as I have already explained, is a second-order anticircumvention measure.  The joint opinion's handling of § 323(f) is perhaps most telling, as it upholds § 323(f) only because [****333]  of "Congress' eminently reasonable prediction that . . . state and local candidates and officeholders will become the next conduits for the soft-money funding of sham issue advertising."  Ante, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 574 (emphasis added).  That is, this Court upholds a [**732]  third-order anticircumvention measure based on Congress' anticipation of circumvention of these second-order anticircumvention measures that might possibly, at some point in the future, pose some problem. 
It is not difficult to see where this leads.  Every law has limits, and there will always be behavior not covered by the law but at its edges; behavior easily characterized as "circumventing" the law's prohibition.  Hence, speech regulation will again expand to cover new forms of "circumvention," only to spur supposed circumvention of the new  [*269]  regulations, and so forth.  Rather than permit this never-ending and self-justifying process, I would require that the Government explain why proposed speech restrictions are needed in light of actual Government interests, and, in particular, why the bribery laws are not sufficient. 
B 
But Title I falls even on the joint opinion's terms.  This Court has held that "[t]he quantum of empirical evidence [****334]  needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments will vary up or down with the novelty and plausibility of the justification raised."  Shrink Missouri, 528 U.S., at 391, 145 L. Ed. 2d 886, 120 S. Ct. 897.  And three Members of today's majority have observed that "the opportunity for corruption" presented by "[u]nregulated 'soft money' contributions" is "at best, attenuated."  Colorado I, 518 U.S., at 616, 135 L. Ed. 2d 795, 116 S. Ct. 2309 (opinion of Breyer, J., joined by O'Connor and Souter, JJ.).  Such an observation is quite clearly correct.  A donation to a political party is a clumsy method by which to influence a candidate, as the party is free to spend the donation however it sees fit, and could easily spend the money as to provide no help to the candidate.  [***628]  And, a soft-money donation to a party will be of even less benefit to a candidate, "because of legal restrictions on how the money may be spent." Brief for FEC et al. in No. 02-1674 et al., p 43.  It follows that the defendants bear an especially heavy empirical burden in justifying Title I. 
The evidence cited by the joint opinion does not meet this standard and would barely suffice for anything more than rational-basis review.  The first category [****335]  of the joint opinion's evidence is evidence that "federal officeholders have commonly asked donors to make soft-money donations to national and state committees solely in order to assist federal campaigns, including the officeholder's own."  Ante, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 550 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But to the extent that donors and federal officeholders have collaborated so that donors could give donations to a national party committee "for  [*270]  the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office," the alleged soft-money donation is in actuality a regular "contribution" as already defined and regulated by FECA.  See 2 USC § 431(8)(A)(i) [2 USCS § 431(8)(A)(i)].  Neither the joint opinion nor the defendants present evidence that enforcement of pre-BCRA law has proved to be impossible, ineffective, or even particularly difficult. 
The second category is evidence that "lobbyists, CEOs, and wealthy individuals" have "donat[ed] substantial sums of soft money to national committees not on ideological grounds, but for the express purpose of securing influence over federal officials."  Ante, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 551.  Even if true (and the cited evidence consists of nothing more than vague allegations of wrongdoing),  [****336]  it is unclear why existing bribery laws could not address this problem.  Again, neither the joint opinion nor the defendants point to evidence that the enforcement of bribery laws has been or would be ineffective.  If the problem has been clear and widespread,  [**733]  as the joint opinion suggests, I would expect that convictions, or at least prosecutions, would be more frequent. 
The third category is evidence characterized by the joint opinion as "connect[ing] soft money to manipulations of the legislative calendar, leading to Congress' failure to enact, among other things, generic drug legislation, tort reform, and tobacco legislation."  Ante, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 552.  But the evidence for this is no stronger than the evidence that there has been actual vote buying or vote switching for soft money.  The joint opinion's citations to the record do not stand for the propositions that they claim.  For instance, the McCain declaration does not provide any evidence of any exchange of legislative action for donations of any kind (hard or soft). 3  [****338]   [*271]  Neither do the Simpson or Simon declarations, with perhaps one exception effectively addressed by Justice Kennedy's  [***629]  opinion. 4  See post, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 648-649.  In fact, the findings [****337]  by two of the District Court's judges confirm that the evidence of any quid pro quo corruption is exceedingly weak, if not nonexistent.  See 251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 349-352 (DC 2003) (Henderson, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); id., at 851-853 (Leon, J.).  The evidence cited by the joint opinion is properly described as "at best, [the Members of Congress'] personal conjecture regarding the impact of soft money donations on the voting practices of their present and former colleagues."  Id., at 852 (Leon, J.). 
The joint opinion also places a substantial amount of weight on the fact that "in 1996 and 2000, more than half of the top 50 soft-money donors gave substantial sums to both major national parties," and suggests that this fact "leav[es] room for no other conclusion but that these donors were seeking influence, or avoiding retaliation, rather than promoting any particular ideology."  Ante, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 551 (emphasis in original).  But that is not necessarily the case.  The two major parties are not perfect ideological opposites, and supporters or opponents of certain policies or ideas might find substantial overlap between the two parties.  If donors feel that both major parties are in general agreement over an issue of importance to [****339]  them, it is unremarkable that such  [*272]  donors show support for both parties.  This commonsense explanation surely belies the joint opinion's too-hasty conclusion drawn from a relatively innocent fact. 
The Court today finds such sparse evidence sufficient.  This cannot be held to satisfy even the "relatively complaisant review" of Beaumont, 539 U.S., at ___, 156 L. Ed. 2d 179, 123 S. Ct. 2200 (slip op., at 14), unless, as it appears, the Court intends to abdicate entirely its role. 5 
 [**734]  II 
The Court is not content with "balanc[ing] away First Amendment freedoms," Shrink Missouri, 528 U.S., at 410, 145 L. Ed. 2d 886, 120 S. Ct. 897 (Thomas, J., dissenting), in the context of the restrictions imposed by Title I, which could arguably (if wrongly) be thought to be mere contribution limits.  The Court also, in upholding virtually all of Title II, proceeds to do the same for limitations on expenditures, [****340]  which constitute "political expression 'at the core of our electoral process and of the First Amendment freedoms,'" Buckley, 424 U.S., at 39, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612 (quoting  Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23, 32, 21 L. Ed. 2d 24, 89 S. Ct. 5 (1968)).  Today's holding continues a disturbing trend: the steady decrease in the level of scrutiny applied to restrictions on core political speech. See  Buckley, supra, at 16, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612 (First Amendment requires "exacting scrutiny"); Shrink Missouri, supra, at 387, 145 L. Ed. 2d 886, 120 S. Ct. 897 (applying "Buckley's standard  [***630]  of scrutiny"); Beaumont, supra, at ___ , 156 L. Ed. 2d 179, 123 S. Ct. 2200 (slip op., at 14) (referencing "relatively complaisant review"). 6  Although this trend is most obvious in the review of contribution limits, it has now reached what even this Court today would presumably recognize as a direct restriction on core political speech: limitations on independent expenditures. 
 [****341]  [*273]   A 
Of course, by accepting Congress' expansion of what constitutes "coordination" for purposes of treating expenditures as limitations, the Court can pretend that it is, in fact, still only restricting primarily "contributions." I need not say much about this illusion.  I have already discussed how the language used in new FECA § 315(a)(7)(B)(ii) is, even under Buckley's framework, overly broad and restricts fully protected speech.  See  Federal Election Comm'n v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 533 U.S. 431, 467-468, 150 L. Ed. 2d 461, 121 S. Ct. 2351 (2001) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (Colorado II). The particular language used, "expenditures made by any person . . . in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, a national, State, or local committee of a political party," BCRA § 214(a)(2), captures expenditures with "no constitutional difference" from "a purely independent one."  Id., at 468, 150 L. Ed. 2d 461, 121 S. Ct. 2351 (Thomas, J., dissenting). 7  And new FECA § 315(a)(7)(C), although using the neutral term "coordinated," certainly has the purpose of "clarif[ying] the scope of the preceding subsection, § 315(a)(7)(B)," ante, at ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 585 (joint opinion), and [****342]  thus should be read to be as expansive as the overly broad language in § 315(a)(7)(B).  Hence, it too is unconstitutional. 
B 
As for §§ 203 and 204, the Court rests its decision on another vast expansion of the First Amendment framework described in Buckley, this time of the Court's, rather than Congress', own making.  In Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652, 659-660, 108 L. Ed. 2d 652, 110 S. Ct. 1391 (1990), the [**735]  Court recognized a "different type of corruption" from the "'financial quid pro quo'": the "corrosive and distorting effects of immense  [*274]  aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political [****343]  ideas." The only effect, however, that the "immense aggregations" of wealth will have (in the context of independent expenditures) on an election is that they might be used to fund communications to convince voters to select certain candidates over others.  In other words, the "corrosive and distorting effects" described in Austin are that corporations, on behalf of their shareholders, will be able to convince voters of the correctness of their ideas.  Apparently,  [***631]  winning in the marketplace of ideas is no longer a sign that "the ultimate good" has been "reached by free trade in ideas," or that the speaker has survived "the best test of truth" by having "the thought . . . get itself accepted in the competition of the market."  Abrams, 250 U.S., at 630, 63 L. Ed. 1173, 40 S. Ct. 17 (Holmes, J., dissenting).  It is now evidence of "corruption." This conclusion is antithetical to everything for which the First Amendment stands.  See, e.g., First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 790, 55 L. Ed. 2d 707, 98 S. Ct. 1407 (1978) ("[T]he fact that advocacy may persuade the electorate is hardly a reason to suppress it"); Kingsley Int'l Pictures Corp. v. Regents of Univ. of N. Y., 360 U.S. 684, 689, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1512, 79 S. Ct. 1362 (1959) [****344]  ("[I]n the realm of ideas [the Constitution] protects expression which is eloquent no less than that which is unconvincing"). 
Because Austin's definition of "corruption" is incompatible with the First Amendment,  I would overturn Austin and hold that the potential for corporations and unions to influence voters, via independent expenditures aimed at convincing these voters to adopt particular views, is not a form of corruption justifying any state regulation or suppression.  Without Austin's peculiar variation of "corruption," §§ 203 and 204 are supported by no compelling government interest.  The joint opinion does not even argue that these provisions  [*275]  address quid pro quo corruption. 8  And the shareholder protection rationale is equally unavailing.  The "shareholder invests in a corporation of his own volition and is free to withdraw his investment at any time and for any reason," Bellotti, supra, at 794, n. 34, 55 L. Ed. 2d 707, 98 S. Ct. 1407.  Hence, no compelling interest can be found in protecting minority shareholders from the corporation's use of its general treasury, especially where, in other contexts, "equally important and controversial corporate decisions are made by management [****345]  or by a predetermined percentage of the shareholders." Ibid.
C 
I must now address an issue on which I differ from all of my colleagues: the disclosure provisions in BCRA § 201, now contained in new FECA § 304(f).  The "historical evidence indicates that Founding-era Americans opposed attempts to require that anonymous authors reveal their identities on the ground that forced disclosure [**736]  violated [****346]  the 'freedom of the press.'"  McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U.S. 334, 361, 131 L. Ed. 2d 426, 115 S. Ct. 1511 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring). 9  Indeed, this Court has explicitly recognized that "the interest in having anonymous works enter the marketplace  [***632]  of ideas unquestionably outweighs any public interest in requiring disclosure  [*276]  as a condition of entry," and thus that "an author's decision to remain anonymous . . . is an aspect of the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment."  Id., at 342, 131 L. Ed. 2d 426, 115 S. Ct. 1511.  The Court now backs away from this principle, allowing the established right to anonymous speech to be stripped away based on the flimsiest of justifications. 
 [****347]  The only plausible interest asserted by the defendants to justify the disclosure provisions is the interest in providing "information" about the speaker to the public.  But we have already held that "[t]he simple interest in providing voters with additional relevant information does not justify a state requirement that a writer make statements or disclosures she would otherwise omit."  Id., at 348, 131 L. Ed. 2d 426, 115 S. Ct. 1511.  Of course, Buckley upheld the disclosure requirement on expenditures for communications using words of express advocacy based on this informational interest.   424 U.S., at 81, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612.  And admittedly, McIntyre purported to distinguish Buckley.  McIntyre, supra, at 355-356, 131 L. Ed. 2d 426, 115 S. Ct. 1511.  But the two ways McIntyre distinguished Buckley--one, that the disclosure of "an expenditure and its use, without more, reveals far less information [than a forced identification of the author of a pamphlet,]"  514 U.S., at 355, 131 L. Ed. 2d 426, 115 S. Ct. 1511; and two, that in candidate elections, the "Government can identify a compelling state interest in avoiding the corruption that might result from campaign expenditures," id., at 356, 131 L. Ed. 2d 426, 115 S. Ct. 1511 --are inherently implausible.  [****348]  The first is simply wrong.  The revelation of one's political expenditures for independent communications about candidates can be just as revealing as the revelation of one's name on a pamphlet for a noncandidate election. See also id., at 384, 131 L. Ed. 2d 426, 115 S. Ct. 1511 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  The second was outright rejected in Buckley itself, where the Court concluded that independent expenditures did not create any substantial risk of real or apparent corruption.  424 U.S., at 47, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612.  Hence, the only reading of McIntyre that remains consistent with the principles it contains is that it overturned Buckley to the extent that Buckley upheld a disclosure requirement solely based on the governmental interest in providing information to the voters. 
 [*277]  The right to anonymous speech cannot be abridged based on the interests asserted by the defendants.  I would thus hold that the disclosure requirements of BCRA § 201 are unconstitutional.  Because of this conclusion, the so-called advance disclosure requirement of § 201 necessarily falls as well. 10 
 [****349]  [***633]  [**737]    D 
I have long maintained that Buckley was incorrectly decided and should be overturned.  See  Colorado II, 533 U.S., at 465, 150 L. Ed. 2d 461, 121 S. Ct. 2351;  Shrink Missouri, 528 U.S., at 410, 145 L. Ed. 2d 886, 120 S. Ct. 897; Colorado I, 518 U.S., at 640, 135 L. Ed. 2d 795, 116 S. Ct. 2309.  But, most of Title II should still be held unconstitutional even under the Buckley framework.  Under Buckley and Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U.S. 238, 93 L. Ed. 2d 539, 107 S. Ct. 616 (1986) (MCFL), it is, or at least was, clear that any regulation of political speech beyond communications using words of express advocacy is unconstitutional.  Hence, even under the joint opinion's framework, most of Title II is unconstitutional, as both the "primary definition" and "backup definition" of "electioneering  [*278]  communications" cover a significant number of communications that do not use words of express advocacy. 2 USC § 434(f)(3)(A) (Supp. II) [2 USCS § 434(f)(3)(A)]. 11 
 [****350]  In Buckley, the Court was presented with the ambiguous language "'any expenditure . . . relative to a clearly identified candidate.'"  424 U.S., at 41, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612.  The Court noted that the "use of so indefinite a phrase as 'relative to' a candidate fails to clearly mark the boundary between permissible and impermissible speech." Ibid. Hence, the Court read the phrase to mean "advocating the election or defeat of a candidate."  Id., at 42, at 42, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But this construction did not complete the vagueness inquiry.  As the Court observed: 
"[T]he distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application.  Candidates, especially incumbents, are intimately tied to public issues involving legislative proposals and governmental actions.  Not only do candidates campaign on the basis of their positions on various public issues, but campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest." Ibid.
The Court then recognized that the constitutional issues raised by the provision "can be avoided only by reading [*279]  § 608(e)(1) as limited to communications [****351]  that include explicit words of advocacy of election or defeat  [***634]  of a candidate."  Id., at 43, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612. 
 [**738]  The joint opinion argues that Buckley adopted this narrow reading only to avoid addressing a constitutional question.  "[T]he concept of express advocacy and the concomitant class of magic words were born of an effort to avoid constitutional infirmities," concludes the joint opinion after examining the language of  Buckley.  Ante, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 578-579.  This ignores the fact that the Court then struck down the expenditure limitation precisely because it was too narrow: 
"The exacting interpretation of the statutory language necessary to avoid unconstitutional vagueness thus undermines the limitation's effectiveness as a loophole-closing provision by facilitating circumvention by those seeking to exert improper influence upon a candidate or officeholder. It would naively underestimate the ingenuity and resourcefulness of persons and groups desiring to buy influence to believe that they would have much difficulty devising expenditures that skirted the restriction on express advocacy of election or defeat but nevertheless benefited the candidate's campaign. Yet no substantial societal [****352]  interest would be served by a loophole-closing provision designed to check corruption that permitted unscrupulous persons and organizations to expend unlimited sums of money in order to obtain improper influence over candidates for elective office."  424 U.S., at 45, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612.
Far from saving the provision from constitutional doubt, the Court read the provision in such a way as to guarantee its unconstitutionality.  If there were some possibility that regulation of communications without words of express advocacy were constitutional, the provision would have to have been read to include these communications, and the constitutional  [*280]  question addressed head on. 12  Indeed, the exceedingly narrow reading of the relevant language in Buckley is far from mandated by the text; it is, in fact, a highly strained reading.  "'[A]ny expenditure . . . relative to a clearly identified candidate,'" id., at 41, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612, would be better read to cover, for instance, any expenditure for an advertisement aired close to an election that is "intended to influence the voters' decisions and ha[s] that effect," a standard apparently endorsed by the joint opinion as being sufficiently "equivalent"  [****353]  to express advocacy to justify its regulation. Ante, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at 587-588.  By deliberately adopting a strained and narrow reading of the statutory text and then striking down the provision in question for being too narrow, the Court made clear that regulation of nonexpress advocacy was strictly forbidden. 
This reading is confirmed by other portions of Buckley and by other cases.  For instance, in limiting FECA's disclosure provisions to expenditures involving express advocacy,  [***635]  the Court noted that it gave such a narrowing interpretation "[t]o insure that the reach of [the disclosure provision] is not impermissibly [****354]  broad."  424 U.S., at 80, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612 (emphasis added).  If overbreadth were a concern in limiting the scope of a disclosure provision, it surely was equally a concern in the limitation of an actual cap on expenditures. And, in MCFL, the Court arguably eliminated any ambiguity remaining in Buckley when it explicitly stated that the narrowing interpretations taken in Buckley were [**739]  necessary "in order to avoid problems of overbreadth."  MCFL, 479 U.S., at 248, 93 L. Ed. 2d 539, 107 S. Ct. 616.  The joint opinion's attempt to explain away MCFL's uncomfortable language is unpersuasive.  The joint opinion emphasizes that the MCFL Court "held that a 'similar construction'  [*281]  must apply to the expenditure limitation," as if that somehow proved its point.   Ante, at ____, n 76, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 578-579 (emphasis in original).  The fact that the MCFL Court said this does not establish anything, of course; adopting a narrow construction of a statute "in order to avoid problems of overbreadth,"  479 U.S., at 248, 93 L. Ed. 2d 539, 107 S. Ct. 616, is perfectly consistent with a holding that, lacking the narrowing construction, the statute would be overly broad, i.e., unconstitutional. 
The defendants' principal argument in response [****355]  is that 
"it would be bizarre to conclude that the Constitution permits Congress to prohibit the use of corporate or union general treasury funds for electioneering advertisements, but that the only standard that it can constitutionally use (express advocacy) is one that misses the vast majority (88.6 percent) of advertisements that candidates themselves use for electioneering." Brief for FEC et al. in No. 02-1674 et al., p 103 (emphasis in original).
The joint opinion echoes this, stating that the express advocacy line "cannot be squared with our longstanding recognition that the presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech from a true issue ad."  Ante, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 579.  First, the presence of the "magic words" does differentiate in a meaningful way between categories of speech.  Speech containing the "magic words" is "unambiguously campaign related," Buckley, supra, at 81, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612, while speech without these words is not.  Second, it is far from bizarre to suggest that (potentially regulable) speech that is in practice impossible to differentiate from fully protected speech must be fully protected.  It is, rather, part and [****356]  parcel of First Amendment first principles.  See, e.g., Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234, 255, 152 L. Ed. 2d 403, 122 S. Ct. 1389 (2002) ("The Government may not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech.  Protected speech does not become unprotected merely because it resembles the latter.  The Constitution  [*282]  requires the reverse").  In fact, First Amendment protection was extended to that fundamental category of artistic and entertaining speech not for its own sake, but only because it was indistinguishable, practically, from speech intended to inform.  See  Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U.S. 495, 501, 96 L. Ed. 1098, 72 S. Ct. 777 (1952); Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, 510, 92 L. Ed. 840, 68 S. Ct. 665 (1948) (rejecting  [***636]  suggestion that "the constitutional protection for a free press applies only to the exposition of ideas" as the "line between the informing and the entertaining is too elusive for the protection of that basic right," noting that "[w]hat is one man's amusement, teaches another's doctrine").  This principle clearly played a significant role in Buckley itself, see  424 U.S., at 42, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612 (after noting that "the distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy [****357]  of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application," holding that the "express advocacy" standard must be adopted as the interpretation of the relevant language in FECA).  The express-advocacy line was drawn to ensure the protection of the "discussion of issues and candidates," not out of some strange obsession of the Court to create meaningless lines.  And the joint opinion misses the point when it notes that "Buckley's express advocacy line, in short, has not aided the legislative effort to combat real or apparent corruption." Ante, at ____ - ____,  157 L. Ed. 2d, at [**740]  579-580.  Buckley did not draw this line solely to aid in combating real or apparent corruption, but rather also to ensure the protection of speech unrelated to election campaigns. 13 
 [****358]  Nor is this to say that speech with words of express advocacy is somehow less protected, as the joint opinion claims.  [*283]   Ante, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 587.  The Court in Buckley recognized an informational interest that justified the imposition of a disclosure requirement on campaign-related speech.  See  424 U.S., at 81, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612.  This interest is not implicated with regard to speech that is unrelated to an election campaign. Hence, it would be unconstitutional to impose such a disclosure requirement on nonelection-related speech.  And, as "the distinction between discussion of issues and candidates . . . may often dissolve in practical application," id., at 42, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612, the only way to prevent the unjustified burdening of nonelection speech is to impose the regulation only on speech that is "unambiguously campaign related," id., at 81, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659, 96 S. Ct. 612, i.e., speech using words of express advocacy. Hence, speech that uses words of express advocacy is protected under the same standard, strict scrutiny, as all other forms of speech.  The only difference is that, under Buckley, there is a governmental interest supporting some regulation of those using words of express advocacy not present [****359]  in other forms of speech. 
* * * 
The chilling endpoint of the Court's reasoning is not difficult to foresee: outright regulation of the press.  None of the rationales offered by the defendants, and none of the reasoning employed by the Court, exempts the press.  "This is so because of the difficulty, and perhaps impossibility, of distinguishing, either as a matter of fact or constitutional law, media  [***637]  corporations from [nonmedia] corporations."  Bellotti, 435 U.S., at 796, 55 L. Ed. 2d 707, 98 S. Ct. 1407 (Burger, C. J., concurring).  Media companies can run procandidate editorials as easily as nonmedia corporations can pay for advertisements. Candidates can be just as grateful to media companies as they can be to corporations and unions.  In terms of "the corrosive and distorting effects" of wealth accumulated by corporations that has "little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas," Austin, 494 U.S., at 660, 108 L. Ed. 2d 652, 110 S. Ct. 1391, there is no distinction between a media corporation and  [*284]  a nonmedia corporation. 14  [****361]  Media corporations are influential.  There is little [**741]  doubt that the editorials and commentary they run can affect elections. Nor is there any doubt that media [****360]  companies often wish to influence elections. One would think that the New York Times fervently hopes that its endorsement of Presidential candidates will actually influence people.  What is to stop a future Congress from determining that the press is "too influential," and that the "appearance of corruption" is significant when media organizations endorse candidates or run "slanted" or "biased" news stories in favor of candidates or parties?  Or, even easier, what is to stop a future Congress from concluding that the availability of unregulated media corporations creates a loophole that allows for easy "circumvention" of the limitations of the current campaign finance laws? 15 
Indeed, I believe that longstanding and heretofore unchallenged opinions such as  Miami Herald Publishing Co. v Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241, 41 L. Ed. 2d 730, 94 S. Ct. 2831 (1974), are in peril.  There, the Court noted that "[c]hains of newspapers, national newspapers, national wire and news services, and one-newspaper towns, are  [*285]  the dominant features of a press that has become noncompetitive and enormously powerful and influential in its capacity to manipulate popular opinion and change the course of events."  Id., at 249, 41 L. Ed. 2d 730, 94 S. Ct. 2831.  Despite expressing some sympathy for those arguing for a legally created "right of access" to encourage diversity in viewpoints in the media, the Court struck down such laws, noting that these laws acted both to [****362]  suppress speech and to "intru[de] into the function of editors" by interfering with "the exercise of editorial control and judgment."  Id., at 257-258, 41 L. Ed. 2d 730, 94 S. Ct. 2831.  Now, supporters of such laws need only argue that the press' "capacity to manipulate  [***638]  popular opinion" gives rise to an "appearance of corruption," especially when this capacity is used to promote a particular candidate or party.  After drumming up some evidence, 16  laws regulating media outlets in their issuance of editorials would be upheld under the joint opinion's reasoning (a result considered so beyond the pale in Miami Herald Publishing that the Court there used it as a reductio ad absurdum against the right-of-access law being addressed, see  id., at 256, 41 L. Ed. 2d 730, 94 S. Ct. 2831).  Nor is there anything in the joint opinion that would prevent Congress from imposing the Fairness Doctrine, not just on radio and television broadcasters, but on the entire media. See  Red Lion Broadcasting, 395 U.S., at 369, 23 L. Ed. 2d 371, 89 S. Ct. 1794 (defining the "fairness doctrine" as a "requirement that discussion of public issues be presented . . . and that each side of those issues must be given fair coverage"). 
 [****363]  [*286]   Hence, "the freedom of the press," described as "one of the greatest bulwarks of liberty," 1 J. Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 335 (____ ed. 1876)  [**742] (declaration of Rhode Island upon the ratification of the Constitution), 17  could be next on the chopping block.  Although today's opinion does not expressly strip the press of First Amendment protection, there is no principle of law or logic that would prevent the application of the Court's reasoning in that setting.  The press now operates at the whim of Congress.
