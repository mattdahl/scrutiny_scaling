Prior History:  [****1]  CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
Syllabus




Respondent stockholder brought this action seeking damages in favor of petitioner Bethlehem Steel Corp., a Delaware corporation, and injunctive relief because of advertisements in connection with the 1972 Presidential election that petitioner corporate directors had authorized from general corporate funds in alleged violation of 18 U. S. C.  § 610, which prohibits corporations from making contributions or expenditures in connection with specified federal elections. Respondent alleged jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.  § 1331 and sought to state a private claim for relief under 18 U. S. C.  § 610, and also invoked pendent jurisdiction for an ultra vires claim under Delaware law.  The District Court's denial of a preliminary injuncton was upheld on appeal, following which respondent dropped the pendent claim rather than post security for expenses under state law before proceeding with that claim.  The District Court then granted petitioners' motion for summary [****2]  judgment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the passage of the election had not mooted the case since damages were sought and that "a private cause of action, whether brought by a citizen to secure injunctive relief or by a stockholder to secure injunctive or derivative damage relief [is] proper to remedy violation of § 610." After the Court of Appeals decision Congress enacted the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974 (hereinafter the Amendments), under which, inter alia, the Federal Election Commission can receive citizen complaints of statutory violations and where warranted request the Attorney General to seek injunctive action.  Held: 
1. The Amendments constitute an intervening law that relegates to the Commission's cognizance respondent's complaint as citizen or stockholder for injunctive relief against any alleged violations of § 610 in future elections, since this Court must examine this case according to the law existing at the time of its decision.  United States v. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103, 110; Bradley v. Richmond School Board, 416 U. S. 696, 711. Pp. 74-77.  
2.  Respondent stockholder's derivative suit with [****3]  regard to the alleged 1972 violation cannot be implied under 18 U. S. C.  § 610, and respondent's remedy, if any, must be under Delaware's corporation law.  Pp. 77-85.
(a) Section 610 was primarily concerned, not with the internal relations between corporations and stockholders, but with corporations as a source of aggregated wealth and therefore of potential corrupting influence; thus this statute differs from other criminal statutes in which private causes of action have been inferred because of a clearly articulated federal right in the plaintiff, e. g., Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, or a pervasive legislative scheme governing the relationship between the plaintiff class and the defendant class in a particular regard, e. g., J. I. Case Co.  v. Borak, 377 U. S. 426. Pp. 78-82.  
(b) The legislative history of § 610 suggests no congressional intention to vest in corporate shareholers a federal right to damages for a violation of the statute.  Pp. 82-84.  
(c) A private remedy would not further the statutory purpose of dulling corporate influence on federal elections since any compelled repayment [****4]  to the corporation might well not deter the initial violation.  P. 84.  
(d) The cause of action is one traditionally relegated to state law in an area of primarily state concern.  In addition to the ultra vires claim urged by respondent the alleged misuse of corporate funds might, under the law of some States, give rise to a cause of action for breach of a fiduciary duty.  Pp. 84-85.  
496 F.2d 416, reversed.

Opinion




 [*68]   [***31]   [**2083]  MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court. 
 [1A]There are other questions, but the principal issue presented for decision is whether a private cause of action for damages against corporate directors is to be implied in favor of a corporate stockholder under 18 U.S.C.  § 610, a criminal statute prohibiting corporations from making "a contribution or expenditure in connection with any election at which Presidential and Vice Presidential electors… are to be voted for." 1   [**2084]  We conclude  [*69]  that implication of such a federal cause  [***32]  of action is not suggested by the legislative context of § 610 or required to accomplish Congress' purposes in enacting the statute. We therefore have no occasion to address  [*70]  the questions whether § 610, properly construed, proscribes the expenditures alleged in this case, or whether the statute is unconstitutional as violative of the First Amendment or of the equal [****6]  protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. 
 [****7]  I 
In August and September 1972, an advertisement with the caption "I say let's keep the campaign honest. Mobilize 'truth squads'" appeared in various national publications, including Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News and World Report, and in 19 local newspapers in communities where Bethlehem Steel Corp. (Bethlehem), a Delaware corporation, has plants. Reprints of the advertisement, which consisted mainly of quotations from a speech by petitioner Stewart S. Cort, chairman of the board of directors of Bethlehem, were included with the September 11, 1972, quarterly dividend checks mailed to the stockholders of the corporation. The main text of the advertisement appealed to the electorate to "encourage responsible, honest, and truthful campaigning." It alleged that vigilance was needed because "careless rhetoric and accusations… are being thrown around these days - their main target being the business community." In italics, under a picture of Mr. Cort, the advertisement quoted "the following statement made by a political candidate: 'The time has come for a tax system that says to big business -- you must pay your fair share.'" It then printed Mr. Cort's rejoinder to this in his speech,  [****8]  including his opinion that to say "large corporations [are] not carrying their fair share of the tax burden" is "baloney." The advertisement concluded with an offer to send, on request, copies of Mr. Cort's entire speech 2  and a folder "telling how to  [*71]  go about activating Truth Squads." 3  These publications could be obtained free from the Public Affairs Department of Bethlehem. It is stipulated that the entire costs of the advertisements and various mailings were paid from Bethlehem's general corporate funds. App. A29-A30; 350 F. Supp. 227, 229 (ED Pa. 1972). 
 [****9]  Respondent owns 50 shares of Bethlehem stock and was qualified to vote in the 1972 Presidential election. He filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on September 28, 1972, on behalf of himself and, derivatively, on behalf of Bethlehem.  [***33]  The complaint specified two separate and distinct bases for jurisdiction and relief. Count I alleged jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  § 1331 and sought to state a private claim for relief under 18 U.S.C.  § 610, which, as mentioned, in terms provides only for a criminal penalty. Count II invoked pendent jurisdiction for a claim under Delaware law, alleging that the corporate campaign expenditures were "ultra vires, unlawful and [a] willful, wanton and gross breach of [defendants'] duty owed to [Bethlehem]." Immediate injunctive relief against further corporate expenditures in connection with  [**2085]  the 1972 Presidential election or any  [*72]  future campaign was sought, as well as compensatory and punitive damages in favor of the corporation. 
The District Court denied a preliminary injunction on October 25, 1972.  350 F. Supp. 227. [****10]  While the denial was supported on three grounds, 4  it was upheld on appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit only on the narrow ground that irreparable harm was not shown.  471 F. 2d 811 (1973). 5  
 [****11]   [2A] [3A] [4A] [5A]After the affirmance on appeal, petitioners sought an order requiring respondent to post security for expenses as required by Pennsylvania law. The court declined to order such security with regard to the federal cause of action alleged in Count I, but did order respondent to post $ 35,000 before proceeding with the pendent claim under Count II. Rather than post security, respondent filed an amended complaint, which dropped Count II, the separate state cause of action, from the case. 6  
 [2B]
 [****12]   [*73]  The  [***34]   [**2086]  District Court then granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment without opinion. The Court of Appeals reversed, 496 F. 2d 416 (1974). The Court of  [*74]  Appeals held that, since the amended complaint sought damages for the corporation for violation of § 610, the controversy was not moot, although the election which occasioned it was past. The Court of Appeals held further that "a private cause of action, whether brought by a citizen to secure injunctive relief or by a stockholder to secure injunctive or derivative damage relief [is] proper to remedy violation of § 610." Id., at 424. We granted certiorari, 419 U.S. 992 (1974). We reverse. 
II 
 [6]We consider first the holding of the Court of Appeals that respondent has "a private cause of action… [as] a citizen [or as a stockholder] to secure injunctive relief." The 1972 Presidential election is history, and respondent as citizen or stockholder seeks injunctive relief only as to future elections. In that circumstance, a statute enacted after the decision [****13]  of the Court of Appeals, the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. 93-443, 88 Stat. 1263 (Amendments) (amending the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, 86 Stat. 3), requires reversal of the holding of the Court of Appeals. 
 [7A]In terms, § 610 is only a criminal statute, providing a fine or imprisonment for its violation. At the time this suit was filed, there was no statutory provision for civil enforcement of § 610, whether by private parties or by a Government agency. But the Amendments created a Federal Election Commission, 2 U.S.C.  § 437c (a)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. IV); 7  established an administrative  [*75]  procedure for processing complaints of alleged violations of § 610 after January 1, 1975, 2 U.S.C.  § 437g (1970 ed., Supp. IV), and § 410, note following 2 U.S.C.  § 431 (l970 ed., Supp. IV); and provided that "[a]ny person who believes a violation… [of section 610] has occurred may file a complaint with  [***35]  the Commission." 2 U.S.C.  § 437g (a)(1)(A) (1970 ed.  [****14]  , Supp. IV). The Commission must either investigate the complaint or refer the complaint to the Attorney General, 2 U.S.C.  §§ 437g (a)(2)(A) and (B) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). 8  [****16]  If the Commission chooses to investigate the complaint, and after investigation determines that "any person has engaged or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation" of § 610, the Commission may request the Attorney General to "institute a civil action for relief, including a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or any other appropriate order…." 2 U.S.C.  § 437g (a)(7) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). And 2 U.S.C.  § 437c (b) (1970 ed., Supp. IV), expressly vests the Commission with "primary jurisdiction" over any claimed violation of § 610 within its  [*76]  purview. 9  Consequently, a complainant  [**2087]  seeking as citizen or stockholder to enjoin alleged violations of § 610 in future elections must henceforth pursue the statutory remedy of a complaint to the Commission, and invoke its authority to request the Attorney General to seek the injunctive relief. H.R. Conf. Rep.  [****15]  No. 93-1438, p. 94 (1974). Thus, the Amendments constitute an intervening law that relegates to the Commission's cognizance respondent's complaint as citizen or stockholder for injunctive relief against any alleged violations of § 610 in future elections. In that circumstance, the holding of the Court of Appeals must be reversed, for our duty is to decide this case according to the law existing at the time of our decision.  
 [7B] 


 [****17]   [8]The governing rule was announced by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in United States v. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103, 110 (1801): S
"It is in the general true that the province of an  [*77]  appellate court is only to enquire whether a judgment when rendered was erroneous or not. But if subsequent to the judgment and before the decision of the appellate court, a law intervenes and positively changes the rule which governs, the law must be obeyed, or its obligation  [***36]  denied. If the law be constitutional… I know of no court which can contest its obligation…. In such a case the court must decide according to existing laws, and if it be necessary to set aside a judgment, rightful when rendered, but which cannot be affirmed but in violation of law, the judgment must be set aside."I 

We most recently reaffirmed the principle of Schooner Peggy in Bradley v. Richmond School Board, 416 U.S. 696, 711 (1974), where we said: "We anchor our holding in this case on the principle [****18]  that a court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision, unless doing so would result in manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary." There is no "statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary" in or respecting the Amendments, nor is there any possible "manifest injustice" in requiring respondent to pursue with respect to alleged violations which have yet to occur the statutory remedy for injunctive relief created by the Amendments. 
III 
 [1B]Our conclusion in Part II pretermits any occasion for addressing the question of respondent's standing as a citizen and voter to maintain this action, for respondent seeks damages only derivatively as stockholder. Therefore, we turn next to the holding of the Court of Appeals that "a private cause of action… by a stockholder to secure… derivative damage relief [is] proper to remedy violation of § 610." We hold that such relief  [*78]  is not available with regard to a 1972 violation under § 610 itself, but rather is available, if at all, under Delaware law governing corporations.  [****19]  10  
 
 [9]In  [**2088]  determining whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute not expressly providing one, several factors are relevant. First, is the plaintiff "one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted," Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Rigsby, 241 U.S. 33, 39 (1916) (emphasis supplied) - that is, does the statute create a federal right in favor of the plaintiff? Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one? See, e.g., National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. National Assn. of Railroad Passengers, 414 U.S. 453, 458, 460 (1974) [****20]  (Amtrak).  Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff? See, e.g., Amtrak, supra; Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Barbour, 421 U.S. 412, 423 (1975); Calhoon v. Harvey, 379 U.S. 134 (1964). And finally, is the cause of action one traditionally relegated to state law, in an area basically the concern of the States, so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law? See Wheeldin v. Wheeler, 373 U.S. 647, 652  [***37]  (1963); cf.  J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 434 (1964); Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388, 394-395 (1971); id., at 400 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment). 
The dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals and petitioners here suggest that where a statute provides a penal remedy alone, it cannot be regarded as creating a  [*79]  right in any particular class of people. "Every criminal statute is designed to protect some individual, public, or social interest…. To find an implied civil cause of action for the plaintiff [****21]  in this case is to find an implied civil right of action for every individual, social, or public interest which might be invaded by violation of any criminal statute. To do this is to conclude that Congress intended to enact a civil code companion to the criminal code." 496 F. 2d, at 428-429 (Aldisert, J., dissenting). Cf.  Nashville Milk Co. v. Carnation Co., 355 U.S. 373, 377 (1958). 
 [10]Clearly, provision of a criminal penalty does not necessarily preclude implication of a private cause of action for damages.  Wyandotte Transportation Co. v. United States, 389 U.S. 191, 201-202 (1967); see also J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, supra; Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Rigsby, supra. However, in Wyandotte, Borak, and Rigsby, there was at least a statutory basis for inferring that a civil cause of action of some sort lay in favor of someone. 11  Here,  [**2089]  there was nothing more than  [*80]  a bare criminal statute, with absolutely no indication [****22]  that civil enforcement of any kind was available to anyone. 
 [****23]  We need not, however, go so far as to say that in this circumstance a bare criminal statute can never be deemed sufficiently protective of some special group so as to give rise to a private cause of action by a member of that group. For the intent to protect corporate shareholders particularly was at best a subsidiary purpose of § 610, and the other relevant factors all either are not helpful or militate against implying a private cause of action. 
First, § 610 is derived from the  [***38]  Act of January 26, 1907, 12  which "seems to have been motivated by two considerations. First, the necessity for destroying the influence over elections which corporations exercised through financial contribution. Second, the feeling that corporate officials had no moral right to use corporate funds for contribution to political parties without the consent of the stockholders." United States v. CIO, 335 U.S. 106, 113 (1948). See 40 Cong. Rec. 96 (1905)  [*81]  (Annual Message of President Theodore Roosevelt). Respondent bases his derivative action on the second purpose, claiming that the intent to protect stockholders from use of their invested funds for political purposes [****24]  demonstrates that the statute set up a federal right in shareholders not to have corporate funds used for this purpose. 
However, the legislative history of the 1907 Act, recited at length in United States v. Auto Workers 352 U.S. 567 (1957), demonstrates that the protection of ordinary stockholders was at best a secondary concern. 13  Rather, the primary purpose of the 1907 Act, and of the 1925 Federal Corrupt Practices Act, 43 Stat. 1070, which  [*82]  re-enacted the [****25]  1907 provision with some changes as § 313 of that Act, see United States v. Auto Workers, supra, at 577, was to assure that federal elections are "'free from the power of money,'" 352 U.S., at 574, to eliminate "'the apparent hold on political parties which business interests… seek and sometimes obtain by reason of liberal campaign contributions.'"  [**2090]  Id., at 576, quoting 65 Cong. Rec. 9507 (1924) (remarks of Sen. Robinson). See also 352 U.S., at 571-577.  [***39]  Thus, the legislation was primarily concerned with corporations as a source of aggregated wealth and therefore of possible corrupting influence, and not directly with the internal relations between the corporations and their stockholders. In contrast, in those situations in which we have inferred a federal private cause of action not expressly provided, there has generally been a clearly articulated federal right in the plaintiff, e.g., Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, supra, or a pervasive legislative scheme governing the relationship between the plaintiff class and the defendant class in a particular regard, e.g., J.I. Case Co. v. Borak, supra. [****26]  
 [****27]   [11]Second, there is no indication whatever in the legislative history of § 610 which suggests a congressional intention to vest in corporate shareholders a federal right to damages for violation of § 610. True, in situations in which it is clear that federal law has granted a class of persons certain rights, it is not necessary to show an intention to create a private cause of action, although an explicit purpose to deny such cause of action would be controlling. 14  But where, as here, it is at least dubious  [*83]  whether Congress intended to vest in the plaintiff class rights broader than those provided by state regulation of corporations, the fact that there is no suggestion at all that § 610 may give rise to a suit for damages or, indeed, to any civil cause of action, reinforces the conclusion that the expectation, if any, was that the relationship  [*84]  between  [***40]  corporations and their stockholders would continue to be entrusted entirely to state law. 


 [****28]   [12]Third, while "it is the duty of the courts to be alert to provide such remedies as are necessary to make effective the congressional purpose," J.I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S., at 433, in this instance the remedy sought would not aid the primary congressional goal. Recovery  [**2091]  of derivative damages by the corporation for violation of § 610 would not cure the influence which the use of corporate funds in the first instance may have had on a federal election. Rather, such a remedy would only permit directors in effect to "borrow" corporate funds for a time; the later compelled repayment might well not deter the initial violation, and would certainly not decrease the impact of the use of such funds upon an election already past. 

 [13][14][15]Fourth, and finally, for reasons already intimated, it is entirely appropriate in this instance to relegate respondent [****29]  and others in his situation to whatever remedy is created by state law. In addition to the ultra vires action pressed here, see n. 6, supra, the use of corporate funds in violation of federal law may, under the law of some States, give rise to a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty. See, e.g., Miller v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 507 F. 2d 759 (CA3 1974). Corporations are creatures of state law, and investors commit their funds to corporate directors on the understanding that, except where federal law expressly requires certain responsibilities of directors with respect to stockholders, state law will govern the internal affairs of the corporation. If, for example, state law permits corporations to use corporate funds as contributions in state elections, see Miller, supra, at 763 n. 4, shareholders are on notice that their funds may be so used and have no recourse under any federal statute. We are  [*85]  necessarily reluctant to imply a federal right to recover funds used in violation of a federal statute where the laws governing the corporation may put a shareholder on notice that there may be no such recovery. 
In Borak, supra, [****30]  we said: "[If] the law of the State happened to attach no responsibility to the use of misleading proxy statements, the whole purpose of [§ 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934] might be frustrated." 377 U.S., at 434-435. Here, committing respondent to state-provided remedies would have no such effect. In Borak, the statute involved was clearly an intrusion of federal law into the internal affairs of corporations; to the extent that state law differed or impeded suit, the congressional intent could be compromised in state-created causes of action. In this case, Congress was concerned, not with regulating corporations as such, but with dulling their impact upon federal elections. As we have seen, the existence or nonexistence of a derivative cause of action for damages would not aid or hinder this primary goal. 
Because injunctive relief is not presently available in light of the Amendments, and because implication of a federal right of damages on behalf of a corporation under § 610 would intrude into an area traditionally committed to state law without aiding the main purpose of § 610, we reverse. 
It is so ordered.
